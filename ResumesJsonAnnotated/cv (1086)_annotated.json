I desire to further research and development in the field of machine vision \nand Simultaneous Localization and Ma pping (SLAM).  \n \nMy journey into electrical engineering started when I was 12 years old and my uncle taught me how to solder so \nI could fix my guitar cable. When he saw my eagerness to learn he proceeded to make me a kit of various \ncomponents and supply me w ith some basic project instructions. Ever since then I have been hooked. As a kid I \nwould take apart electronic devices to see how they worked, build electronics kits from MarVac  Electronics  and \nexperiment by circuit bending all types of battery powered toys.  \n \nOver the summer I worked  on a project  for a promising up -and-coming company in product development. I \ntook on the task of developing an Android Application for remote control, via Bluet ooth, of a robotic toy. While \nI did not have prior experience in application development, I had taken on the challenge and sought out various \nresources to get the job done. I also had the chance to take on jobs outside the scope of electrical engineering. \nThis includes troubleshooting construction and graphic design elements for the products exterior. The \nexperience as a whole has piqued my interest in User Experience Design (UXD) , and product development \noverall . \n \nIn the near future I se e myself working my  way up to division manager. I feel that my interpersonal skills that I \nhave developed while working as an Instructional Aide for the Severely Handicapped and Interpreter for the \nDeaf and Hard of Hearing are invaluable. I have extensive knowledge in  workin g with large groups of people as \nwell as facilitating communication between individuals of varying backgrounds and  intellectual abilities. Also, \ngiven my work in the education field, I am well -versed in data collection and making recommendations that are \nbacked -up with adequate information.  \n \nGiven the opportunity, I would enjoy the chance to develop my 3D modeling/printing and printed circuit board \ndesign/fabrication skills during my time at The Robot Company.  I also look forward to the opportunity of \natten ding any and all workshops offered  to make myself a well-rounded  engineer. I am a lifelong learner who is \nalways looking to explore new fields of knowledge.  I would also enjoy working w ith your experienced \nengineers Nicholas Lombardo and Nick Vuono.  \n \nIf you have any questions feel free to contact me. I look forward to hearing back from you about the \nopportunities at The Robot Company.  \n \n \nSincerely,  \nLawrence Swift  \n \n  Lawrence Swift  \n1234  My Drive, Huntington Beach, CA 92646
