TECHNICALS SKILLS:\nProgramming Languages: C# Web Technologies: SharePoint 2010, ASP.NET 4.0/3.5/2.0, MVC 4 Application Software: Visual Studio\n2008/2010/2013, SQL Server Management Studio Databases: SQL Server 2005/2008 R2, MySQL, Oracle Others: HTML, JQuery,\nCSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JIRA Source Controls: Team Foundation Sever, GitHub, Visual Source Safe PROJECTS AT WORK: 1)\nLEDGER: Ledger is developed to manage the task of invoice clearance for different finance benefits trust accounts of Pratt & Whitney. It is\nalso used to track invoices charged back to the department budget or to the various business units. The primary objective of this project\nwas to migrate the existing application which was developed in MS-Access to a web based application by implementing security and adding\nadditional business rules. 2) DEBTS (Daily Equity Based Tax Solution): DEBTS is a tool which is used to calculate employee tax based on\ncertain parameters (medical, social security tax factor). It is developed for UTC USA and deals with all UTC employees' daily equity tax.\nUBS will place a flat file each day in SFTP with all transactions performed by the employees of UTC. The typical flat file contains employee\nid, country code, tax details etc. DEBTS tool will connect to SFTP and downloads flat file to perform the validation rules, at last tool will\ndecide the record status (there are 3 statuses as Valid, Exception and Pending). User can login to the system and can review the exception\nrecords. And also user can rectify the exceptions to move the exception record to valid records and send the funding files to ADP. 3)\nSupplier Portal Supplier Portal is designed in SharePoint 2010 to collaborate with their authorized suppliers. Supplier Portal is a merge of\nseven legacy Pratt and Whitney existing applications into a single portal. The features that are available simplify the way their suppliers can\naccess required business & technical information, as well as how they can provide P&W with valuable delivery information. It is one of the\nmain communication portals and it plays a major role in doing business with Pratt & Whitney. Apart from SharePoint 2010, we used SQL\nServer 2012 and ASP.Net to develop this application. 4) eRFA (electronic Request For Agreement): RFA is an agreement between two\nparties (Company and Client) before they start the work. This process involved more than eight approvers to approve the agreement. The\nexisting process which involves manual submission has many problems such as knowing status of agreement, percentage of completion and\napproval status etc. The new eRFA application is developed in SharePoint as an electronic application which has more flexible UI to\ncapture all required data and it eliminated most of the manual efforts in terms of searching for online results and internal applications to\nvalidate the data entered by requester, more flexible approval process and status tracking. 5) Export Logging Tool Export Logging Tool is a\nweb based application to collect and log all export activities occurring at Pratt & Whitney Military Engines with a simple interface with an\nability to generate various reports required to report of export events. Apart from these features it also includes the facility of uploading bulk\ndata into the database which needs to be validated for the correctness of the data against business rules which determine the type of data\nthat can be uploaded into each column.
