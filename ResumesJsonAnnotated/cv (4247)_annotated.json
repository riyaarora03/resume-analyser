Additional\nComments \nI have been working in the Aviation industry for 12 years now and bring with me a total on 15 years of experience that makes me a\nwell-seasoned professional. I bring with me experience of working with commercial, military, charter, and prototype aircraft. I am experienced and\nknowledgeable with Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier, Dornier, and Lockheed and have proven myself to be both versatile when working with various\naircraft makes & customers.\nExperience\nJanuary 2011\nto\nCurrent\nCompany Name\n \nCity\n \n, \nState\n \nPurchaser / Production Coordinator\nMy journey at Flightstar began with production coordinating, where I was responsible for interfacing with leads, project managers, and\ncustomer representatives regarding aircraft documentation, parts status, and any problems that may affect the delivery schedule.\nIn this position I was responsible for aircraft paperwork and work cards during the maintenance visits.\nI worked one on one with purchasing to ensure the proper communication of parts that could affect aircraft delivery and help expedite these\nparts as necessary.\nWhen services were required either in house or items being sent out for any kind of testing or repair, I would provide complete and accurate\npaperwork to purchasing.\nDaily reporting of parts statuses, man hours, and aircraft schedule was a daily task.\nBeing a coordinator first and already having experience in purchasing made my transition to a buyer smooth since I could now work more\nclosely with the coordinators with each of us able to support one another better with part status updates and any paperwork issues.\nLike coordinators I have to interface with leads, project managers, and customer representatives.\nIn addition I have to communicate between various departments at FAS such accounting to make sure that material is paid and billed\naccurately as well as quality to make sure that the parts purchase are up to standard and come from an approved source.\nBeing on both sides of the fence I know see that coordinators spend more time corresponding between the different areas of the job where\nbuyers spend more time on parts themselves.\nPurchasers are responsible for every part purchased or requested and Have the sole responsibility of resolving any materials needed.\nI have to not only purchase the parts but also validate the paperwork or trace is acceptable and legal.\nIf it isn't, resolve any rejected parts by means of returns and credits.\nBuyers are responsible for expediting all orders and making sure that they are received as needed.\nWe then report this information to the coordinators and project managers as necessary.\nOutside vendor interaction is a big part of purchasing and we have to form business relationships to effectively perform or duties.\nIn addition I am responsible for meeting standards and performance metrics within the company to make that we are functioning at an\nindustry standard to rise above the competition.\nPurchasing is also responsible for cost savings such engaging in supplier contracts and rebate programs.\nThese savings of course benefits everyone on the company.\nPurchasers are a point of contact between FAS, suppliers, and customers regarding materials so effective communication and reporting is\nkey in this position.\nFebruary 2009\nto\nDecember 2010\nCompany Name\n \nCity\n \n, \nState\n \nPurchasing Clerk / Material Specialist\nWorking with Vision Airlines included a lot of different \nresponsibilities.\nNot only was I responsible for quoting and purchasing materials for both Aircraft and Stock, but also included Stores / Warehouse,\nShipping, and Receiving responsibilities.\nBeing a smaller Airline I work closely with the Executive staff as well as the owners of the company themselves.\nAfter receiving a Material Order Request, I would acquire the necessary quotes to find the best price and lead time available.\nIf needed, get approval to proceed with the order.\nCoordinate and expedite the shipping and payment process to get the material where it needs to be in a timely manner.\nI would match invoice with purchase orders and track shipments to assure their arrival.\nUpon receipt of material, I then would verify proper certification of the material, receive into the system, and label as required.\nOnce material is ready to be used, issue from the system to assure all records was correct.\nAll of this required constant tracking using Excel, Word, and Adobe.\nI kept records of all transactions whether it was materials needing to be ordered, Purchase Orders themselves, Invoices needing to be paid,\nor items that that have already been received.\nAs well as certifications and any other information requested from maintenance.If an item needed to be shipped I was responsible for the proper packaging, handling, and traceability to be done in a professional manner.\nAs part of the AOG team I would be called on at any time to locate and facilitate the material where the urgent requirement may be.\nThis involved having key information to acquire the material and coordinate with the proper logistics necessary.\nAlso as a valued member of the material group I have represented the Airline at maintenance facilities to properly manage the material being\nordered and used for an Aircraft.\nFebruary 2005\nto\nJanuary 2009\nCompany Name\n \nCity\n \n, \nState\n \nPurchasing Agent / Material Expeditor\nI started working as a Material Expeditor which required me to work closely with Purchasing, Maintenance, and the Airline.\nBeing an Expeditor had responsibilities that could change day by day depending on what was required of me.\nI provided daily reports and expedited any material needed to keep the production process flowing efficiently.\nThis meant coordinating the order and shipment process, as well as the actual delivery of the material.\nMy responsibility as a Purchasing Agent is to find price and availability on material needed and then order and track for prompt shipment.\nThis requires me to deal directly with the vendors and develop relationships for future business.\nI also retrieve any and all paperwork required, retrieving certification, submit any and all signatures necessary, and expedite the material in a\ntimely fashion.\nOnce I have received the material I then facilitate and expedite the flow of materials to and from various departments.\nI have worked with many different Airline companies as well as Military, which all have high and demanding standards to meet.\nWith this job no two days are the same, it is a constant change with challenging obstacles.\nIn addition to being a Buyer and Expeditor, I was responsible for doing spare Sales to sister and contract companies.\nThis required the technique of verifying stock, quoting material, ensuring proper certification, and shipping.\nBetween the three job functions I was constantly providing and coordinating AOG orders support.\nClientlogic (DELL).\nEducation\n1/2010\nTransportation \nDangerous Goods \nDevelopment Group \nTraining Certificate\n8/2009\nVision Airlines \nMaintenance Indoctrination Course \nTraining
