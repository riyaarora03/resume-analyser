When any fault like short circuit \noccurs, voltage drop will vary depending on the length of fault in cable, since the \ncurrent varies.  \n\uf0b7 we detect the exact location of short circuit fault in the underground cab le from \nfeeder end in kilometers  by using microcontroller  8051.  So, i t can be easily detected \nand repaired.  \nCOMPUTER SKILLS                                        \n    Languages              :     basics of C, C++  \n    Packages    :       MS office  \n    Designin g Tools   :       Matlab,  \n    Operating Systems  :       Windows XP, 07, 08  \nPROFICIENCY IN LANGUAGE  \nLanguage  Speak  Read  Write  \nEnglish   \n\uf0fc   \n\uf0fc   \n\uf0fc  \nTamil   \n\uf0fc   \n\uf0fc   \n\uf0fc  \n \n PERSONAL DETAIL S \n     Father\u2019s Name   : Mr. A.
