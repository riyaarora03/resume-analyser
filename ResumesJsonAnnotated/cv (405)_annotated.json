The bicycle fabricated was single framed with a bent below the \ndriver\u2019s seat which acted as a suspension system.\n\uf0b7Development of Electronically Controlled Proportioning Directional Servo Valve \nsponsored by KSCST, Bangaluru\nDescription: In this project, flow rate and pressure of hydraulic system is controlled by\nintelligent electronic system. Directional Control Valve and DC Servo Motor is joined by\nflexible coupling and then connected to hydraulic system and the electronic system. Thus,\nthrough  stepwise  movement  of  spool  of  DCV,  hydraulic  system  can  be  controlled  as\ndesired.\nAchievements:\n\uf0b7Secured 91/100 in Mechanics of Materials(Top ten in University)\n\uf0b7Founded SAEINDIA BIET Collegiate Club\n\uf0b7Team Captain of SUPRA-SAEINDIA\nSoftware Skills:\n\uf0b7Solid Edge, ANSYS, SSCNC and Master CAM\nExtra-Curricular Activities:\n\uf0b7Participated in TECHSPIN\u201912 conducted by SDM, Dharwad\n\uf0b7Participated in Quiz Competition  organized on Feb 28, 2012 by Science Forum, BIET\n                                             ", "annotations": [[619, 628, "SKILL: Challenge"], [65, 70, "SKILL: GMail"], [1564, 1569, "SKILL: ANSYS"], [1192, 1200, "SKILL: Flexible"], [1543, 1549, "SKILL: skills"], [580, 588, "SKILL: Projects"], [1351, 1354, "SKILL: CAN"], [1497, 1501, "SKILL: Club"], [404, 414, "SKILL: Simulation"], [1740, 1747, "SKILL: Science"], [75, 83, "SKILL: Location"], [188, 197, "SKILL: Education"], [1581, 1587, "SKILL: Master"], [539, 543, "SKILL: Feel"], [220, 225, "SKILL: Board"], [707, 711, "SKILL: Team"], [651, 658, "SKILL: College"], [1043, 1047, "SKILL: Flow"], [475, 483, "SKILL: Training"], [894, 900, "SKILL: System"], [1146, 1153, "SKILL: Control"], [1086, 1088, "SKILL: IS"], [1588, 1591, "SKILL: CAM"], [1057, 1065, "SKILL: Pressure"], [601, 604, "SKILL: ECO"], [735, 740, "SKILL: Drive"], [380, 386, "SKILL: Design"], [1417, 1426, "SKILL: Mechanics"], [1534, 1549, "SKILL: Software Skills"], [783, 786, "SKILL: CAR"], [451, 455, "SKILL: Tech"], [45, 50, "SKILL: Email"], [255, 265, "SKILL: Mechanical"], [1552, 1557, "SKILL: SOLID"], [388, 399, "SKILL: Development"], [71, 74, "SKILL: COM"], [662, 673, "SKILL: Engineering"], [203, 209, "SKILL: Degree"], [1069, 1078, "SKILL: Hydraulic"], [1534, 1542, "SKILL: Software"], [1609, 1619, "SKILL: Activities"], [495, 498, "SKILL: Oil"], [852, 858, "SKILL: Driver"], [605, 610, "SKILL: Green"], [1711, 1720, "SKILL: Organized"], [338, 339, "SKILL: X"], [1430, 1439, "SKILL: Materials"], [694, 701, "SKILL: Project"], [436, 440, "SKILL: Meta"]]}
