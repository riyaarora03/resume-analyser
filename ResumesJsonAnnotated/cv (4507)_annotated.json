sixteen years I was a leader of change for the largest law firm in the Central Pennsylvania area with over 275 in office users at 6\nlocations and over 200 work from home users.\nI was a visionary in regards to technical business operations, responsible for providing professional staff at various locations with efficient,\nup-to-date, secure and stable voice and data communications on a daily basis within budget.\nThe ability to use good judgment, proven technologies and industry standards to balance ease of use with security.\nI am a fast paced leader with the patience to oversee the

directly managed a staff of seven information technical professionals as well as\nparticipating in many project implementation teams and initiatives.\nI am experienced in many of the technical methods, tools and applications used in business operations with the ability to connect multiple\noffices with highly secure and redundant Internet connections.\nWhile at the firm I was able to receive better than competitive pricing for the circuits due to the quantity of services required as well as my\nvendor negotiation skills.\nI have the technical knowledge and experience required for the strategic planning and funding of annual and multi-year business operations.\nMy efforts have resulted in a direct costs savings in business operations.\nMost recently, we implemented user provided smart phones and free apps to provide efficient digital dictation and provided mobile\ncapability to access our document management system.\nI have a dedicated work ethic that is required to oversee day-to-day technical business operations updating and upgrading systems in use\nwhile at the same time implementing new systems: Upgraded the firms bread-n-butter time and billing financial
