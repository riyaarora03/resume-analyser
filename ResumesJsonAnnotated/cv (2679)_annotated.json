Higher temperature  can blast the \ntransformer. From this display indication we limit the load current in order \nto avoid bursting of transformer we need to maintain load current \nconstantly and if the temperature  value increase  beyond predefined value, \nit\u2019s alerted by using an alarm circuit.  \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION  EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES  \n \nDECL ARATION  ADDITIONAL COURSES  \n \nPAP ER PRESENTATION WORKSHOPS /INDUSTRIAL VISIT  \n \nEXPERIANCE  ", "annotations": [[186, 193, "SKILL: Ability"], [1978, 1983, "SKILL: GMail"], [2719, 2728, "SKILL: Soldering"], [76, 85, "SKILL: Knowledge"], [246, 273, "SKILL: Interpersonal relationships"], [2063, 2066, "SKILL: age"], [213, 221, "SKILL: Flexible"], [2898, 2908, "SKILL: Technology"], [4295, 4300, "SKILL: BLAST"], [453, 456, "SKILL: GPS"], [3233, 3254, "SKILL: Electrical Technician"], [3284, 3287, "SKILL: LTD"], [3995, 4006, "SKILL: Transformer"], [2261, 2267, "SKILL: skills"], [2358, 2362, "SKILL: Time"], [3271, 3279, "SKILL: Projects"], [4291, 4294, "SKILL: CAN"], [668, 674, "SKILL: Mobile"], [2410, 2419, "SKILL: solutions"], [1163, 1170, "SKILL: History"], [3289, 3290, "SKILL: C"], [2020, 2028, "SKILL: Passport"], [617, 623, "SKILL: Global"], [2711, 2716, "SKILL: Parts"], [150, 157, "SKILL: Advance"], [2202, 2210, "SKILL: Location"], [2309, 2318, "SKILL: Education"], [4486, 4491, "SKILL: Value"], [3080, 3085, "SKILL: VisIT"], [3146, 3154, "SKILL: Contract"], [1090, 1093, "SKILL: AVS"], [954, 959, "SKILL: Board"], [4065, 4071, "SKILL: Sensor"], [1109, 1116, "SKILL: College"], [3499, 3508, "SKILL: Languages"], [3980, 3991, "SKILL: Measurement"], [2341, 2349, "SKILL: Training"], [438, 444, "SKILL: System"], [812, 819, "SKILL: Control"], [86, 88, "SKILL: IS"], [4140, 4143, "SKILL: ADC"], [120, 132, "SKILL: Organization"], [344, 354, "SKILL: Electrical"], [2976, 2981, "SKILL: Solar"], [2111, 2124, "SKILL: Qualification"], [2283, 2295, "SKILL: Competencies"], [4329, 4336, "SKILL: Display"], [260, 273, "SKILL: Relationships"], [1332, 1337, "SKILL: State"], [2674, 2681, "SKILL: Service"], [2863, 2870, "SKILL: Filters"], [234, 239, "SKILL: build"], [1416, 1425, "SKILL: Permanent"], [1947, 1952, "SKILL: Email"], [430, 437, "SKILL: Locking"], [186, 202, "SKILL: Ability to grasp"], [17, 28, "SKILL: Hardworking"], [1984, 1987, "SKILL: COM"], [3628, 3639, "SKILL: Information"], [1052, 1063, "SKILL: Engineering"], [2438, 2440, "SKILL: SE"], [1386, 1389, "SKILL: DAM"], [2476, 2478, "SKILL: CS"], [2404, 2409, "SKILL: Power"], [1186, 1193, "SKILL: Diploma"], [2940, 2945, "SKILL: Level"], [2562, 2570, "SKILL: Software"], [1990, 2001, "SKILL: Nationality"], [4611, 4621, "SKILL: Activities"], [4683, 4692, "SKILL: Workshops"], [3964, 3967, "SKILL: Oil"], [4052, 4063, "SKILL: Temperature"], [133, 138, "SKILL: Goals"], [3510, 3517, "SKILL: English"], [1036, 1047, "SKILL: Electronics"], [2516, 2518, "SKILL: IT"], [246, 259, "SKILL: Interpersonal"], [417, 425, "SKILL: Tracking"], [3160, 3170, "SKILL: Supervisor"], [2744, 2752, "SKILL: Cleaning"], [3244, 3254, "SKILL: Technician"], [197, 202, "SKILL: Grasp"], [675, 688, "SKILL: communication"], [2991, 2997, "SKILL: Hybrid"], [400, 407, "SKILL: Project"], [3069, 3079, "SKILL: Industrial"], [2381, 2393, "SKILL: Applications"], [4670, 4682, "SKILL: Presentation"], [275, 295, "SKILL: Willingness to learn"], [53, 65, "SKILL: Organisation"], [4257, 4261, "SKILL: Load"], [4428, 4436, "SKILL: Maintain"], [3371, 3380, "SKILL: Technical"]]}
