EV  motors  are  operated  through  the  Power\nelectronic devices and batteries. The AC motors are most popular due to the VFD (Variable frequency\ndrives). AC motors are most efficient and economical for medium and high loads.\nDesign of Induction motors 70kW and 120kW for electric vehicles .  Particularly involvement in this\nproject is design and development of electric motor parts based on theoretical calculations done by hand\nafter implemented in excel and numerical solutions implemented in FEA software. Design of new product\ndevelopment and reverse engineering done for electric vehicle applications.\nRoles and Responsibilities:\nResponsible for providing Theoretical and numerical simulations using Ansys Electromagnetic suite  and\nMATLAB. Involved in product and process design of electromechanical systems and vehicle dynamics and\npre- requirements of motors.\nDuties include,\n\uf0b7Design of 70kW and 120kW motors based on the vehicle requirement.\n\uf0b7Design of new product development for different electrical parts.\n\uf0b7Research and develop ideas for new product and production systems.\n\uf0b7Deliver product based theoretical calculations.\n\uf0b7Provide design support at all stages of design process to internal members and external clients.\n\uf0b7Improve the design, performance, and optimization of existing products.\n\uf0b7Enhance cost efficiency of products with set quality standards of the company.\nSoftware\u2019s: ANSYS Electromagnetic suite (RMxPRT, Mawell2D/3D, Simplorer) and MATLAB\nWorked as a Summer Intern BHEL, Hyderabad     15 Dec to 29 Dec 2014\n\uf0b7Study of manufacturing of Turbo GeneratorEDUCATIONAL QUALIFICATION\n\uf0b7Masters in Power Electronics & Devices  from VIT University, (Vellore, TamilNadu),2016 \u2013 8.22 \n\uf0b7Bachelor of Technology (Electrical & Electronics)  from KMM Institute of Technology & Science,\n(Affiliated to JNTU Ananthapuramu, Andhra Pradesh),2014 \u2013 74.77 %\n\uf0b7Intermediate (MPC) from Sri Chaithanya Jr. College, (Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh) ,2010- 85.9 %\n\uf0b7SSC from Teja High School, (Vempalli, Andhra Pradesh),2008 - 80.33 %\nTECHNICAL SKILLS\n\uf0b7Technical Languages : MATLAB, PSIM, OrCARD, KEIL & ANSYS Electromagnetic suite\n\uf0b7IT Languages : C\nPUBLICATIONS\n\uf0b7D.Sreekanth reddy , \u201cControl of two-phase induction and synchronous motor drives using direct torque\ncontrol\u201d, International Journal of Engineering Research online, Volume No.3, Issue No 6, Year 2015.\n\uf0b7D.Sreekanth reddy ,Kasina v cs Srikanth,V.Ramaraju,D.Elangovan \u201cInterleaved Dual Switch Isolated\nDC to DC Converter with Voltage Tripler for Fuel cell Applications\u201d, In IOSR-JEEE e-ISSN: 2278-\n1676, p-ISSN: 2320-3331, Volume 11, Issue 5 Ver.
