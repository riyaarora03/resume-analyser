{"text": "DAMIAN ROSSIER\nPROFILE\nExpertise EDA modeler. I like to learn what my data contains\nand how well I can model it depending on the problem. I\ncan also leverage different visualization tools to aid the\nunderstanding of the extracted data and finally use the\nrequired ML algorithm to get an outcome. SKILLS\nData Analysis, Business Analysis, Machine\nLearning, Regression Analysis, Time Series\nAnalysis, SQL, Base SAS, Python, NLP, Credit\nRisk, Tableau, Statistical Analysis, Data\nVisualization, Data Science, R, Power Bi.\nEXPERIENCE\nPassionate Solution \nJr. Data Scientist, Feb 2020 - Ongoing\nPerforming EDA and then clean the data to\nfit a model over it.
