Next came requirements to improve processing of future big data formats fulfilled in a Red Hat Linux high compute cluster I designed,\npurchased and accredited for operation in the Enterprise.\u00c2  Improvement on big data analytical processing reduced time from 30 hours to 30\nminutes as well as allow for more robust data thru higher selections of sensors, frequencies and range than allowed thru the traditional process.\nCompany Name\n \nCity\n \n, \nState\n \nSenior Systems Analyst\n \n02/1999\n \nto \n02/2006\nI was hired to improve corporate and client communications and processing requirements which resulted in the design, build and deployment of 3\nEnterprise network solutions. \nOne solution resulted in expanding capabilities to supporting Washington Navy Yard, Norfolk Virginia and Hawaii\nsupport facilities. \nFulfilled requirements for detecting crucial network software/hardware weaknesses and developing preventive strategies and\nsolutions for avoiding interruptions and increasing system security thru documenting system layouts, wiring diagrams and addressing schema to\nunderstand layouts and make informed solutions to upper management. \nEducation
