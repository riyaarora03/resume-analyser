It is mainly used for lifting heavy things and transporting them to other\nplaces. The device uses one or more  simple machines to create mechanical advantage  and\nthus move loads beyond the normal capability of a human. Cranes are commonly employed\nin  the transport industry  for  the  loading  and  unloading  of  freight,  in\nthe construction industry for the movement of materials, and in the manufacturing industry\nfor the assembling of  heavy equipment.\nProject Title: FLY WHEEL\n       Description:  A flywheel is a mechanical device specifically designed to efficiently\nstore rotational  energy. Flywheels  resist changes  in rotational  speed by their  moment  of\ninertia.  The  amount  of  energy  stored  in  a  flywheel  is  proportional  to  the  square  of\nits rotational  speed.  The  way  to  change  a  flywheel  stored  energy  is  by  increasing  or\ndecreasing its rotational speed applying a  torque aligned with its axis of symmetry.\n\uf0d8ACHIEVEMENTS / CO-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES / EXTRA CURRICULAR\nACTIVITIES:\n\uf0d8Auto CAD And Pro/E Certificate.\n\uf0d8Bharat Vikash Parishad Certificate.\nINPLANT TRAINING / INDUSTRIAL VISIT:\nANIL SPECIAL STEEL INDUSTRIES LTD JAIPUR               1 JUNE 2013 TO 30 JUNE 2013PERSONAL PROFILE:\nFather\u2019s Name :Ram Chandra Bairwa\nDate of Birth             : 05th April 1990\nGender                    : Male \nPassport Number : M4017503\nLanguage Known      : English And Hindi\n Hobbies                     :  Singing  Songs,Listening  Music,Reading  Books,Social  \nServices.\nAddress                    :  186,Anantwada  Ka  Gola,  Bairwa  Ki  Dhani,Post-\n    Anantwada,Via-Bandikui,Tehsil-Baswa,District-\nDausa,Rajasthan,India-303313.\nDECLARATION:\nI hereby declare that the above particulars furnished by me are true to the best of my knowledge\nand belief. \nDate:25th July 2017\nPlace:Jaipur                            Bhagwan Sahay Bairwa", "annotations": [[258, 265, "SKILL: Ability"], [1583, 1589, "SKILL: Drives"], [43, 48, "SKILL: GMail"], [1875, 1884, "SKILL: Knowledge"], [2638, 2646, "SKILL: Industry"], [2768, 2781, "SKILL: Manufacturing"], [352, 362, "SKILL: Technology"], [1625, 1638, "SKILL: Commissioning"], [2799, 2809, "SKILL: Assembling"], [3847, 3854, "SKILL: Reading"], [154, 176, "SKILL: Mechanical engineering"], [3534, 3537, "SKILL: LTD"], [1541, 1545, "SKILL: AXIS"], [964, 970, "SKILL: skills"], [860, 880, "SKILL: Practical experience"], [1888, 1893, "SKILL: Panel"], [939, 944, "SKILL: SCADA"], [230, 233, "SKILL: CAN"], [185, 192, "SKILL: Leading"], [53, 59, "SKILL: Mobile"], [289, 295, "SKILL: Growth"], [2768, 2790, "SKILL: Manufacturing Industry"], [731, 739, "SKILL: Robotics"], [715, 722, "SKILL: Process"], [3716, 3724, "SKILL: Passport"], [470, 477, "SKILL: Science"], [2672, 2681, "SKILL: Unloading"], [1308, 1313, "SKILL: Delta"], [508, 514, "SKILL: Senior"], [2568, 2578, "SKILL: Capability"], [3497, 3502, "SKILL: VisIT"], [954, 970, "SKILL: Technical skills"], [2393, 2400, "SKILL: Lifting"], [2948, 2953, "SKILL: STORE"], [1859, 1872, "SKILL: Mobile device"], [1389, 1391, "SKILL: PC"], [419, 426, "SKILL: College"], [1067, 1076, "SKILL: Languages"], [1737, 1741, "SKILL: Flow"], [1218, 1221, "SKILL: ABB"], [3475, 3483, "SKILL: Training"], [1043, 1049, "SKILL: System"], [1034, 1041, "SKILL: Control"], [2186, 2188, "SKILL: IS"], [1346, 1350, "SKILL: Data"], [1021, 1032, "SKILL: Distributed"], [1782, 1790, "SKILL: Pressure"], [1616, 1621, "SKILL: Drive"], [1842, 1853, "SKILL: Communicate"], [193, 205, "SKILL: Organization"], [144, 150, "SKILL: Domain"], [934, 937, "SKILL: DCS"], [1119, 1129, "SKILL: Functional"], [664, 677, "SKILL: Qualification"], [896, 912, "SKILL: Automation Tools"], [2193, 2197, "SKILL: Type"], [3777, 3782, "SKILL: Hindi"], [2992, 2999, "SKILL: Changes"], [3403, 3406, "SKILL: CAD"], [1101, 1108, "SKILL: Diagram"], [2119, 2127, "SKILL: Academic"], [3841, 3846, "SKILL: Music"], [999, 1010, "SKILL: Controllers"], [740, 750, "SKILL: Automation"], [21, 26, "SKILL: Email"], [154, 164, "SKILL: Mechanical"], [3682, 3688, "SKILL: gender"], [1054, 1065, "SKILL: Programming"], [3179, 3185, "SKILL: Change"], [1369, 1375, "SKILL: Screen"], [907, 912, "SKILL: Tools"], [929, 932, "SKILL: PLC"], [1643, 1658, "SKILL: TroubleShooting"], [49, 52, "SKILL: COM"], [165, 176, "SKILL: Engineering"], [992, 997, "SKILL: Logic"], [2820, 2829, "SKILL: Equipment"], [1894, 1900, "SKILL: Wiring"], [2658, 2665, "SKILL: Loading"], [2087, 2092, "SKILL: Power"], [692, 699, "SKILL: Diploma"], [120, 125, "SKILL: Level"], [1708, 1715, "SKILL: Sensors"], [3355, 3365, "SKILL: Activities"], [1412, 1415, "SKILL: HMI"], [1756, 1767, "SKILL: Temperature"], [885, 906, "SKILL: Industrial Automation"], [3765, 3772, "SKILL: English"], [1352, 1363, "SKILL: Acquisition"], [2371, 2373, "SKILL: IT"], [1660, 1670, "SKILL: Pneumatics"], [2315, 2319, "SKILL: Lift"], [1189, 1196, "SKILL: Siemens"], [2628, 2637, "SKILL: Transport"], [297, 304, "SKILL: Success"], [396, 406, "SKILL: Government"], [3016, 3021, "SKILL: Speed"], [318, 332, "SKILL: Qualifications"], [3743, 3751, "SKILL: Language"], [2966, 2972, "SKILL: Energy"], [1574, 1580, "SKILL: Motors"], [689, 691, "SKILL: PG"], [1093, 1099, "SKILL: Ladder"], [1377, 1386, "SKILL: Designing"], [1323, 1334, "SKILL: Supervisory"], [1536, 1537, "SKILL: X"], [2330, 2339, "SKILL: Materials"], [1791, 1799, "SKILL: switches"], [3830, 3839, "SKILL: Listening"], [2128, 2135, "SKILL: Project"], [703, 713, "SKILL: Industrial"], [1167, 1175, "SKILL: Exposure"], [2704, 2716, "SKILL: Construction"], [3871, 3879, "SKILL: Services"], [2687, 2694, "SKILL: Freight"], [1679, 1690, "SKILL: Instruments"], [438, 441, "SKILL: RTU"], [2016, 2023, "SKILL: Systems"], [654, 663, "SKILL: Technical"]]}
