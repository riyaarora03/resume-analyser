{"text": "What is electroplating?\nElectroplating is widely used in various industries for coating metal objects with a thin layer\nof a different metal. The layer of metal deposited has some desired property, which the \nmetal of the object lacks.\nWhy Electroplating?\nElectroplating is known as electro deposition because the process involves depositing a thin \nlayer of metal onto the surface of a work piece, which is referred to as the substrate. An \nelectric current is used to cause the desired reaction.\nProcess of Electroplating?\nA coating is a covering that is applied to the surface of an object, usually referred to as the \nsubstrate. The purpose of applying the  coating may be decorative, functional, or both. \nThe coating itself may be an all-over  coating, completely covering the substrate, or it may \nonly cover parts of the substrate.\nFactors that impact the final plating result include:\n\uf0b7the chemical composition and temperature of the bath\n\uf0b7the voltage level of the electric current\n\uf0b7the distance between the anode and the cathode\n\uf0b7the electrical current application's length of time\nBenefits of Electroplating:\n\uf0d8Many metals posses conductive properties. Conductive metals are incredibly helpful \nin making the electronics, aeronautic, automobile, and communications industries.\n\uf0d8Many types of industrial electroplating create a barrier on the substrate that protects \nit against atmospheric conditions such as corrosion,\uf0d8Ever metal has its purposes, as a result using metals for their hardness, others for \ntheir ductility, or their resistance to corrosion is normal.\n\uf0d8Electroplating is sometimes used to make brittle materials stronger and more \ndurable.\n\uf0d8Plating with these metals protect engine parts and components from damage caused\nby extreme temperatures, which can increase their lifespan\n\uf0d8Plated surfaces are less susceptible to damage when struck or dropped, which can \nincrease their lifespan.\n\uf0d8It is a cost-effective and efficient conductivity solution\n\uf0d8Damage caused by arcing and shorts in electrical parts and components due to \nwhiskers breaking away from materials can be significantly reduced", "annotations": [[1717, 1727, "SKILL: Components"], [1087, 1091, "SKILL: Time"], [1092, 1100, "SKILL: Benefits"], [1778, 1781, "SKILL: CAN"], [314, 321, "SKILL: Process"], [899, 907, "SKILL: Chemical"], [816, 821, "SKILL: Parts"], [1260, 1274, "SKILL: Communications"], [88, 93, "SKILL: Metal"], [853, 859, "SKILL: Impact"], [5, 7, "SKILL: IS"], [1044, 1054, "SKILL: Electrical"], [1614, 1618, "SKILL: Make"], [689, 699, "SKILL: Functional"], [1063, 1074, "SKILL: Application"], [1942, 1951, "SKILL: Efficient"], [1923, 1927, "SKILL: Cost"], [961, 966, "SKILL: Level"], [1827, 1831, "SKILL: LESS"], [924, 935, "SKILL: Temperature"], [1219, 1230, "SKILL: Electronics"], [797, 799, "SKILL: IT"], [387, 391, "SKILL: Work"], [1627, 1636, "SKILL: Materials"], [1302, 1312, "SKILL: Industrial"], [870, 877, "SKILL: Plating"]]}
