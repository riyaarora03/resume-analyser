The main aim to test the \nvarious modules that are to be placed in the BT site. The various modules are \nHero Carousal, Image Carousal, Large Image Carousal, Medium Carousal and so \non where the BT articles can be placed. These modules are tested in the test \nenvironment in Content Management system (CMS).The testing is multi browser \ntesting(IE9,IE10,IE11,Firefox and Chrome) and device testing(iPhone ,IPad and \nSamsung S4).After the testing these modules are given to the content writer of \nthe BT site and they publish the articles in the BT site.Contribution:\nWorked on test case writing, test case execution in desktop as well as in the \ndevices.\n2.ThunderBird_Platform Transformation Project(System Testing)\nClient at&t\nDomain Telecom\nTesting Type Automation and Manual Testing\nTools UsedSelenium,  ConformiQ,  SoupUI,  Sql \nDevoloper\nDefect Tracking \ntool Rally\nMethodology Agile\nThe Purpose of the Project was to simplify the current work flows (e.g., remove \nmanual tasks, consolidate tasks) providing reduced manual effort and preparing \nfor migration into Work Flow Management Platform (NEWTON) and new Order \nCapture Platform. The Project was divided into tracks for easy maintenance (TN \nManagement, Customer Scheduling ,Order Capture, \nWorkflow(OMS,CTH,LPP,SPP),Service Activation, Work Assignment, Digital \nNotifications).\nCTH(Common Task Handler)\nThe tasks that comes from OMS(thick tasks) and OCX(Thin tasks) where to be \nhandled in CTH.CTH was divided into CTH-HIR(Human Interaction Router) and \nCTH-WL, Sasha and AOTS.\nCTH-HIR\nCTH-HIR was where the tasks where to be routed accordingly viz to WL, Sasha, \nAOTS.  Separate rules are to be defined in for routing each task accordingly .Any \ntask that is created will be found in CTH-HIR and from HIR it is routed according \nthe rules declared in Routing table for each source system like \nOCX,OMX,SPP,LPP,CTH etc..\nCTH-WL\nCTH-WL is where a task can be completed ,assigned to any assignee for \ncompletion, unassign a task and claim a task. If the assignee feels the task is \nunable to be completed within the given time, then it can be deferred.\nContribution:\nAutomation Testing:The tool used was Selenium. We also used a tool for the modelling of the test \ncases viz ConformiQ. We model the test cases and with the help of ATTIAF \nconvertor,the modelled English testcases gets converted to selenium scripts.\nManual Testing:\nWorked on test case writing, test case execution. Since the Project was an agile \nproject, the tool used for updating the  test cases results was Rally dev.\n3.ABM-ROS(UI Development):\nThe aim of the project was to convert the application that was already built in \nDotnet to Java platform. The work assigned was in xml pages for the front end \ndevelopment.\nKey Skills:\nAutomation Testing: Selenium with ConformiQ for modelling\nManual Testing: System Testing, VV&T testing.\nACADEMIC PROFILE:\nB.E in Computer Engineering fr om St.Vincent Pallotti college of Engineering & \nTechnology.\nEXAMINATIONS BOARD/UNIVERSITY PERCENTAGE YEAR  OF \nPASSING\nB.E Nagpur university 65% 2013\n12th Andhra Board 92% 2010\n10th C.B.S.E 86% 2008\nSTRENGTHS: Good listener, good team player.\nPERSONAL PROFILE :\nHusband\u2019s Name  :                  Mr. Arun George\nDate of Birth  :                 13 November, 1990\nGender  :                  Female\nMarital Status  :                  Married\nLanguages Known  :                  English ,Hindi, Telugu and Malayalam.Date: 07-04-2015        joyjer80@gmail.com\nPlace:Bengaluru      +91-9880479867", "annotations": [[2837, 2847, "SKILL: Test cases"], [47, 52, "SKILL: GMail"], [3245, 3249, "SKILL: java"], [171, 179, "SKILL: Industry"], [2415, 2421, "SKILL: SOURCE"], [448, 454, "SKILL: iPhone"], [1632, 1641, "SKILL: Migration"], [3541, 3551, "SKILL: Technology"], [1652, 1667, "SKILL: Flow management"], [3137, 3139, "SKILL: UI"], [1668, 1676, "SKILL: Platform"], [3692, 3701, "SKILL: Strengths"], [1876, 1891, "SKILL: Work Assignment"], [3331, 3337, "SKILL: skills"], [1278, 1292, "SKILL: system testing"], [2660, 2664, "SKILL: Time"], [784, 787, "SKILL: CAN"], [3285, 3288, "SKILL: Xml"], [329, 335, "SKILL: Client"], [3675, 3676, "SKILL: C"], [3891, 3905, "SKILL: marital status"], [222, 239, "SKILL: Software Engineer"], [860, 870, "SKILL: Management"], [1255, 1269, "SKILL: Transformation"], [393, 407, "SKILL: Manual testing"], [3468, 3488, "SKILL: Computer Engineering"], [550, 559, "SKILL: Configure"], [2069, 2080, "SKILL: Interaction"], [3566, 3571, "SKILL: Board"], [477, 492, "SKILL: Defect tracking"], [3723, 3727, "SKILL: Team"], [1606, 1612, "SKILL: Effort"], [3515, 3522, "SKILL: College"], [3934, 3943, "SKILL: Languages"], [1764, 1775, "SKILL: Maintenance"], [1652, 1656, "SKILL: Flow"], [1154, 1171, "SKILL: Test case writing"], [1893, 1900, "SKILL: Digital"], [871, 877, "SKILL: System"], [3723, 3734, "SKILL: team player"], [544, 546, "SKILL: IS"], [2945, 2952, "SKILL: Scripts"], [503, 507, "SKILL: JIRA"], [231, 239, "SKILL: Engineer"], [2539, 2549, "SKILL: Completion"], [2220, 2225, "SKILL: Rules"], [3133, 3136, "SKILL: ROS"], [183, 195, "SKILL: Organization"], [265, 271, "SKILL: Domain"], [2742, 2750, "SKILL: Selenium"], [1555, 1560, "SKILL: Tasks"], [1443, 1448, "SKILL: Rally"], [2251, 2258, "SKILL: Routing"], [1207, 1211, "SKILL: WELL"], [1329, 1333, "SKILL: Type"], [3979, 3984, "SKILL: Hindi"], [3137, 3151, "SKILL: UI development"], [3443, 3451, "SKILL: Academic"], [1856, 1863, "SKILL: Service"], [1527, 1532, "SKILL: Flows"], [2705, 2723, "SKILL: Automation testing"], [3196, 3207, "SKILL: Application"], [473, 476, "SKILL: CMS"], [936, 943, "SKILL: Firefox"], [2827, 2832, "SKILL: Model"], [3104, 3111, "SKILL: Results"], [1334, 1344, "SKILL: Automation"], [145, 149, "SKILL: Tech"], [3857, 3863, "SKILL: gender"], [775, 783, "SKILL: Articles"], [1793, 1801, "SKILL: Customer"], [125, 135, "SKILL: Employment"], [437, 442, "SKILL: Tools"], [3553, 3565, "SKILL: Examinations"], [319, 326, "SKILL: Testing"], [1183, 1192, "SKILL: Execution"], [3140, 3151, "SKILL: Development"], [53, 56, "SKILL: COM"], [3477, 3488, "SKILL: Engineering"], [1830, 1838, "SKILL: Workflow"], [852, 877, "SKILL: Content Management System"], [456, 460, "SKILL: iPad"], [837, 848, "SKILL: Environment"], [3468, 3476, "SKILL: Computer"], [222, 230, "SKILL: Software"], [1154, 1163, "SKILL: Test Case"], [499, 501, "SKILL: QC"], [520, 525, "SKILL: AGILE"], [1802, 1812, "SKILL: Scheduling"], [2900, 2907, "SKILL: English"], [1173, 1192, "SKILL: Test Case Execution"], [180, 182, "SKILL: IT"], [1406, 1409, "SKILL: sql"], [484, 492, "SKILL: Tracking"], [508, 519, "SKILL: Methodology"], [1864, 1874, "SKILL: Activation"], [3079, 3087, "SKILL: Updating"], [1164, 1171, "SKILL: Writing"], [1990, 1993, "SKILL: OCx"], [593, 597, "SKILL: Test"], [1522, 1526, "SKILL: Work"], [248, 256, "SKILL: Duration"], [280, 287, "SKILL: Project"], [3736, 3744, "SKILL: Personal"], [2780, 2789, "SKILL: Modelling"], [852, 870, "SKILL: Content Management"], [272, 279, "SKILL: Telecom"], [1548, 1560, "SKILL: Manual tasks"], [852, 859, "SKILL: Content"], [3884, 3890, "SKILL: Female"]]}
