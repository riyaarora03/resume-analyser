Whenever test button is \npressed the  \n         input channels are checked and accordingly corresponding channels o/p is \nconveyed  \n         And announced. Turning of the siren is made by the reset buttons pressed.\n      \n PROJECTS in C.A.T:\n2) Maximum Power  Point Tracking System.\n       Maximum PowerTracking System (MPPT) is used in Photovoltaic (PV) system \nto\n       Maximize the PV array output irrespective of temperature. And Radiation, also\nlocal load         Electrical characteristics .the new MPPT system is developed in which \ncontrolling consist \n       Of buck type of DC-DC Converter that is controlled  by a microcontroller \nbased unit.\n3)   MP3 player.\n     Portable MP3 player based on the PC. It uses an AT89C51.and AT90L/S8535 \n     Microcontroller with its on board memory and STA013 decoder  and DAC. It \nsupports for \n     RS232 communication with PC for down loading fo songs and from the \ninternet.\n   \nPROJETS AT ISRO:\n  4) Base Band Processing Module For Regenerative Payload Simulator.\n Aim of the project is to develop a simulator for the base band processing and \nswitching module\n  of the regenrative payload, which will recive the request from the user \nterminals . the input to \n  this module is request packet from extracted from signaling channel, and \nrespective \n  demodulated signal of the channel to be switched.\n5) TTC RF Power Monitoring System, POWERMETER.\n   The aim of the project is to continuosly monitor the power level at Spacecraft \nend, setting \n   reference level within operating window with data logging and raise the alarm in\ncase there is \n   drastic change in power level. The hardware consist of ADC, RS232, LCD, RAM, \nRTC and \n   battery backup with built in power supply. the system has been provided with \nbuilt in buzzer \n   And external alram.the stand alone mode with internal battery verified for data \nrententivity\n   long term stability of 120 hours.\n6) DDS Based programmable wide band FM modulator.\n   This project is to devlop a wideband digital FM modulator using DDS technique \nthe generated \n   FM signal is to be used as RF uplink signal for satellite receversrs. Developed \ncode for \n   microcontroller which programs AD9850 DDS chip.The controller sets center \nfrequency by\n   loading the tuning words in DDS chip.user can set the frequency and deviation. \nand phase\n  Modulation words are loaded into the AD9850 via parallel byte.center frequency \nranging from \n  10- 20MHz.modulating signal in the range of 283-30KHz.\n  MTECH PROJECT:\n7).Automatic weed detectection and smart herbicide sprayer robot for corn feildsA vision-based guidance method is presented to guide a robot platform which is designed \nindependently to drive through the crops in a field according to the design concept of open \narchitecture. Then, the offset and heading angle of the robot platform are detected in real \ntime to guide the platform on the basis of recognition of a crop using machine vision. This \nproject is basically developed to implement a number of agricultural production in many \ncountries, such as picking, harvesting, weeding, pruning, planting, grafting, agricultural \nclassification etc.\nSEMINARS: \nI)Geographic information system.\nII)Intelligent real time embedded system.\nWORKSHOP:\ni)Two days national level workshop on PSOC and Development in RRS COLLEGE.\nii)Three days national level workshop on WIRELESS and NS/2 OS in GNDEC \nCOLLEGE.\nTECHNOLOGY EXPOSURE:\n     Designing software, Developing Hardware, and Software design, developing\n     Prototype for Embedded Product.\n     Languages: C, Assembly languages for microcontroller and microprocessors.\n     IDE  for 8 bit and 16 bit, 32 bit microcontroller.\n     Emulator use and logic analyzer for development of embedded system.\n     \nEDUCATIONAL PROFILE:\n1)M TECH Embedded system in Electronics and communication from RRS \nfrom JNTU      \n                    \n      2) B.E -Electronics and communication engineering from PDACE GULBARGA.\n           from Gulbarga university Gulbarga in NOV 2001 with   63%.\n      3)  P.U.C -from Sharanbasveswar College of science.\n          Pre University Education Board Karnataka in the year 1997 with 70.16%. \n \n      4) S.S.LC -from Karnataka secondary Education Examination Board\n          In the year 1995 with 68%.\nPERSONAL PROFILE:                                   \n                                     Father name     :     Kupendra B.
