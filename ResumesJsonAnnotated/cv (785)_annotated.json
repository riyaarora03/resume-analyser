{"text": "What is Dropbox?\nDropbox is a free service that lets you bring all your photos, docs, and videos anywhere. Any file you \nsave to your Dropbox will also automatically save to all your computers, phones, and even the Dropbox website. This means that you can start working on your computer at school or the office, and finish on your home computer. Never email yourself a file again!\nThe Dropbox Folder  \nAfter you install Dropbox on your computer, a Dropbox folder is created.
