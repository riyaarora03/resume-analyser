Present design analyzed  on JMAG /ANSYS \nMaxwell  to find out their limitations, Based on that find out simulation results  & new concepts for \ncontact sys tem of the MCCB is generate . Project objective is to enhance repulsion threshold current \n(Irp) of contact system of 250 A frame MCCB. Electromagnetic  repulsion  forces generated between \nmoving & fixed contacts are of repulsive nature due to opposite directi on of current path. The \nmechanical force offered by MCCB mechanism opposes these Electromagnetic repulsion forces . In this \nproject contact pressure (CP) offered by contact springs will be a constant.  \n\uf0b7 Duration:  1 year (July 2014 -April 2015)  \n \n\uf076 Project Title :  Generator  Protection & T esting of R elays . \n\uf076 Company: Gujarat State Electricity Corporation Ltd, Thermal Power Station , Gandhinagar.  \n\uf0b7 Objective : The objective of this project is to unders tand all about generator protection schemes  & \ntheir settings , testing o f some protect ion relay using micro -controller . To protect the generator against \nthe over current, differential and turbine to boiler trip with help of instantaneous micro -controller  \nbased relay, one can practically implement this program. Programming is d one in Code Vision AVR \nsoftware  and simulated in Proteus software . Result of this simula tion is implemented in hardware . \nHardware results are same as software result. These programs  can be used as reference in power plant \nindustries.  \n\uf0b7 Duration : 1 year.
