ASP.Net, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap CSS.\nIDE: \nVisual Studio, Eclipse, NetBeans, Dreamweaver\nDatabase: \nSQL, MySql\nOperating System: \nWindows\nVersion Controls : \nTortoise SVN, GitHub\nOthers: \nMicrosoft Word, Excel, Access, Power point\nExperience\nDatabase Programmer/Analyst (.NET Developer)\n \nJun 2014\n \nto \nFeb 2016\n \nCompany Name\n \n\u00ef\u00bc\u200b \nCity\n \n, \nState\nDescription:\n \u00c2 \nWorked as Graduate Research Assistant performing the duties of Database Programmer/Analyst at Application Development Network (ADN),\nDoIT which supports University of Missouri System faculty and students through agile and rapid creation of new applications.\nProjects:\n \u00c2 \nAtlas: \n\u00c2 \nDescription:\n \u00c2 \nThis project is all about requesting, scheduling the tutoring sessions. There are three roles tied to application they are Tutee, Tutor, and Scheduler.\nA tutee requests for tutoring for the classes that he/she enrolled and gives availability apart from the class timing through Availability Grid and Tutor\nsubmits availability. A scheduler will go through those availabilities and schedule time and location for tutoring. Also, there are some set of rules for\ndropping the tutoring sessions which are incorporated in this project. The other piece of this project is automated emails through Scheduled task\nwhich runs every day.\nResponsibilities:\n \u00c2 \nCreated a Availability Calendar Grid. In grid each cell represents time (1 hour span) and day of the week. Clicking on the cell toggles the\navailability. Automatically populated the course schedule which comes from different database(Worked with data warehouse team in order\nto get that data)\nDeveloped C# Console Application for Scheduled email task.\nGot rid of data tables and table adapters in the main project as they are tightly coupled. Created Class libraries out of the main project to\naccess the database which can be used by both Console Application for Schedule task and web application.\nIntegrated Open Source HTML text editor CKEditor into the website.\nUsed jQuery for filtering, sorting and search the listview, JavaScript for clientside validations.\nUsed role based authorization for various pages.\nOccupational Therapy:\n \u00c2 \nDescription:\n \u00c2 \nThe goal of the project to refractor the old application with new templates and replace the assemblies. Adding functionalities to upload pdf files.\nResponsilities:Created separate Login page for Administrator and Students. Used Active Directory (AD Group) to restrict other department Students.\nDeveloped a web interface for Administrators to upload the pdf files into database which can be viewed by students.\nUpdated the entire application by using new Visual Studio 2013 template which make use of Bootstrap CSS by changing the master pages.\nModified the structure of database to login.\nUsed Redgate SQL Compare to copy the data from database from dev server to test sever.\nReplaced the old ADN Utilities assemblies with new DoIT Utilities assemblies.\nAppInventory: \n\u00c2 \nDescription:\n \u00c2 \nThe goal of the project to allow the admins, managers, scrum masters of the organization to keep track various applications which includes their\ndeveloped, ongoing and future projects. For every application there are application parameters which includes App Structure, Remedy group,\nUser Departments etc. and each application has different version. For each version the parameters are Prod, QA, test URL, DCL, Database,\nplatforms, framework used to develop application, UAT dates etc. Scrum Masters can estimate the length and cost to build the application\n(Project Estimator) based on number of developers, Sprint length, weeks of UAT etc which they can share with clients. After starting the project\nthey can keep track of current progress by budget, sprint burndown charts.\nResponsibilities:\n \u00c2 \nEntity Framework was used using Database first approach.\nLINQ was used in the DAL (Data Access Layer) to interact with the Database\nConsumed ADO.Net Entity Frame Work for Entity Data Model, Entities, Relationship Mapping, and Querying Data.\nConsole Application to import the data from CSV files to populate them into the system.\nAutomatic logout when user is idle for a specified time by using session parameters and JavaScript.\nUsed client side validations, onbeforeunload and onunload events in Javascript.\nWorked on agile environment.\nParticipated in daily scrum meetings to discuss the status of development, planning and estimating the points and UAT.\nGoAdmin:\n \u00c2 \nDescription:\n \u00c2 \nGoMizzou is the University of Missouri flagship mobile application, designed to provide services to all possible users of the university. The goal of\nthis project is to allow GoMizzou Staff to edit the master tables involved with the GoMizzou webservices. These master tables are the starting\npoint for all window services (which feed the web services).\nResponsibilities:\n \u00c2 \nDeveloped Application using AJAX controls like modal popup, ASP.Net server controls like listview, formview, worked on Clientside and\nServer side Validations and created Master Pages.\nFiltering of the data of listview based on the role.\nUsed n-Tier Architecture, Created the Business Logic Layer by using Class Libraries to interact with database.\nModified the existing webservices and windows services.\nCreated ASP.Net User Controls to reduce the complexity of user interface design\nCreated dynamic queries, stored procedures, Views and triggers in SQL server for the database manipulation.\nMizzou Checkout:\n \u00c2 \nThe goal of the project is to develop a web application for Checkout process similar to shopping cart for various departments who met the certain\nrules.\nResponsibilities:\n \u00c2 \nUsed Smtp server to send emails with attachment to the email\nDeveloped C# Class Library to import the data from the CSV file to system\nUsed LIM Service for late fee assessment\nAccess to page based on the role (Role based authentication)\nEducation\nMaster of Science\n \n, \nComputer Engineering\n \nPresent\n \nUniversity of Missouri\n \n\u00ef\u00bc\u200b \nState\n \nGPA: \nGPA: 3.7\n \nComputer Engineering GPA:
