{"text": "PROFILE\nAs a research assistant I always try to define new boundaries and work in a\nmeticulous way to figure out solutions. I have used Machine Learning as a base\nfor our product design to synthesis chemical architectures and their reaction,\nright now I would like to be involved more on the application development side\nand was looking for an opportunity that did such.\nSK JADODIA LABS \nCHEMICAL SYNTHESIS RESEARCH ASISTANT, JAN 2019 - ONGOING\nDeveloped a Machine learning prediction model to optimize steam\nconsumption in MSFE.\nUsing Clustering determined paint molecules that affected\nbreathing issues in children.\nUsing Algorithmic synthesis decided which compounds should be\nadded to an industrial solution to result in a required reaction\nwithout producing toxic waste.SCARLETT MESTOS\nSKILLS\nMATLAB, Python, Aspen, Minitab,\nCatalysis, Research Analysis, Data\nAnalytics, Deep Learning, Machine\nLearning, Process Optimization,\nResearch Scientist, Chemical\nEngineering, Compound\nSynthesis.\nEXPERIENCE\nEDUCATION\nB.TECH CHECMICAL ENGINEERING KSV UNIVERSITY KOCHI, 2017\nM.TECH CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS KSV UNIVERSITY KOCHI, 2019GRADUATE RESEARCHER\nACTIVITIES AND AWARDS\nMATLAB PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE\nMACHINE LEARNING DATA SCIENCE USING PYTHON CERTIFICATEPROJECTS\nUnderstanding Chemical\ncomposition of complex\ncompounds using machine\nlearning and organic molecular\ntelemetry.
