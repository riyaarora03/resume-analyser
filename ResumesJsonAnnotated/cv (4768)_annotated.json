{"text": "LEASING CONSULTANT\nSummary\nMicrosoft Office (4 years), Sales (4 years), Quickbooks (4 years), Performance Management (2 years), Accounting (4 years), Market Research\n(4 years), Marketing Strategy (4 years), Marketing Communications (4 years), Financial Analysis (4 years), Public Relations (4 years)\nAccomplishments\nTo Whom It May Concern, My name is Vincent Hall, and I hate the \"One-Size-Fits-All\" approach to business.\nWhen marketing doesn't feel like marketing, and people organically connect to your message, you've birthed a movement.\nGone are the days of the 1950's where individualism rooted in autonomy allowed one to be labeled as the \"lone wolf\" and heroically\nconquer the \"Corporate Ladder\".\nSimilarly, business entities cannot survive the current globalized, hyper-competitive market through, what I call, \"Corporate -Isolationism\".\nA business, whether a start-up or an established titan of industry, must always find relevant ways connect and communicate with its\naudience.\nMy interest in business started when my friend's step-father told me \"The only road to success is the one you build through work and\ncreativity\".\nThis statement has birthed a passion and drive to not only understand human behavior in what motivates one to buy, but also the mechanics\nbehind product positioning.\nWhat about the product makes it appealing.\nHow can a business increase delivery efficiency.\nHow does a business drive up profit margins while driving down production costs? In conclusion, between my experience in accounting,\nmarketing research, marketing strategy, product positioning, market communication, and public relations has led me to believe two key\nthings.\nFirst, individual's desire to buy hinges on the appealing presentation.\nIt has to be palatable to all five senses within 30 seconds or less.\nSecond, the product must serve a customer's need longer than the next fade of products.\nIn other words, the product must withstand a competitor's product in offering versatile utility and adaptability options to every customer.\nIt is my hope that my communication skills along with my experience in marketing, sales, and accounting will assist in your company's\nprofitability in product positioning.\nExperience\n05/2016\n \nto
