Copper slag  is the\nwaste material of matte smelting and refining of copper such\nthat  each  ton  of copper generates  approximately  2.5  tons of\ncopper  slag.  Copper  slag  is  one  of  the  materials  that  is\nconsidered as a waste which could have a promising future in\nconstruction Industry as partial or full substitute of aggregates.\nFor this research work, M25 grade concrete was used and tests\nwere  conducted  for  various  proportions  of  copper  slag\nreplacement with sand of 0 to 100% in concrete. The obtained\nresults were compared with those of control concrete made with\nordinary Portland cement and sand.\nWorking Experience\nWorked as a Site Engineer & AutoCAD Designer in\nMeeran Construction, Tirunelveli, from May 2011 to June 2013RESUME\uf0b7Reading Books\nCompetencies:\n\uf0b7Good team player, Fast\nLearner.\n\uf0b7Organized and well structured \nat work.\n\uf0b7Committed to deadlines and \nschedules.\n\uf0b7Honest, Sincere with a high \nlevel of Integrity.Responsibilities\n\uf0b7Ensuring that all assigned work is completed on time and \nwithin agreed budgets.\n\uf0b7Supervising Projects: including in house, external \ncontractors and sub-contractors.\n\uf0b7Setting out Project works in accordance with Drawings &\nSpecification\n\uf0b7Maintenance of daily records . \nDECLARATION\n              \nI hereby declare that the above information\u2019s are true to the \nbest of my knowledge.\nThanking you,\nYours faithfully,\n                                                                  Yusuf Haja.
