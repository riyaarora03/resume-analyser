His\nresearch interests are on parallel and distributed compute r architectures, cluster/grid computing, communi-\ncationnetworksandcommunication mechanisms, resourcema nagement, multi-core/System-on-Chip (SoC)\narchitectures, Internet QoS, performance evaluation, fau lt-tolerant computing, mobile computing, multi-\nmedia systems, and security. For the last twenty two years, h e has taught a variety of undergraduate and\ngraduate courses in these areas and has supervised 22 Ph.D. s tudents, more than 50 M.S. students, and 15+\nB.S. (Honors) students. Twelve of his students are now worki ng as faculty members, and two of them are\ndepartment heads.\nThe main theme of Chita\u2019s research is on the design and evalua tion of high performance computer and\ncommunication architectures. In this context, he has worke d on several designs which were used in prior\ncommercial parallel architectures like IBM RP3 and Intel Pa ragon. He is currently working on multi-core\narchitectures which will be the main computing paradigm in n ext few years. In particular, he has worked\nextensively on the wormhole switching technique, which is c urrently used as the communication fabric in\ndesigning high performance computers and clusters. The mos t recent communication architecture, called\nIn\ufb01niBandArchitecture(IBA),thatisusedfordesigningcl usterswithhundredsandthousandsofprocessors\nutilizes wormhole switching.\nChita has published consistently in the above areas in highl y reputed international journals (such as the\nIEEETransactionsonComputers(TC)andIEEETransactionso nParallelandDistributedSystems(TPDS)),\nandhighly selective conference proceedings (suchasISCA, HPCA,ICDCS,MICRO,SIGMETRICS,ICPP,\nFTCS/DSN, ICS, ISPLED, and SPAA), all of which have a typical acceptance rate of 10%-20%. Three of\nhis papers have received the Best Paper Award in three differ ent conferences (ICPP, ICDCS, and PRDC),\nand two additional papers were nominated for the Best Paper A ward. His research has been funded by\nseveral agencies, inparticular theNationalScienceFound ation(NSF)continuously forover20years. Inthe\nlast \ufb01veyears, hehas been aPI/Co-PIof research grants tota ling more than $6.0 million.\nChita, an IEEE Fellow, has served the professional society i n several capacities. He was on the editorial\nboards of the IEEE TC and IEEE TPDS, the two best internationa l journals in computer architectures. He\nhassevred astheChair of TCDP,andiscurrently theChairof t heIEEEComputer Society FellowSelection\nCommittee and the Chair of the IEEE CS Conference Publicatio n Operations Committee (CPOC).
