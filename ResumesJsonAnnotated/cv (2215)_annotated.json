In the proposed system the DTMF decoder, PIR\nsensor, Ultrasonic sensor and the robot is interfaced with the PIC controller. The robot is navigated according\nto the commands given in the mobile. The DTMF decoder will decode the particular data and give it to the\ncontroller. According to the data the robot will move. The PIR sensor is used to check whether any human is\npresent in the area. If any human detected then a message will be send to the monitoring GSM number. The\nultrasonic sensor is used to stop colliding with obstacles. If any obstacle or human detected GPS value is fetch\nby controller and send through GSM \nMINI PROJECT\nDESIGN AND FABRICATION OF RED OBJECT TRACKING 2-AXIS ROBOT USING MATLAB SOFTWARE\nDESIGN AND FABRICATION OF RED OBJECT TRACKING 2-AXIS ROBOT USING MATLAB SOFTWARE\n \nObject tracking can be done by identifying and tracking some specific feature of the moving object such as\ncolor that belongs to the moving object. Thus trajectories of moving object can be traced through this process\nover time. Object tracking using computer vision is a crucial component in achieving robotic surveillance.The\nmain aim of the object tracking is to track the object based on the information obtained from video\nsequences.In our project, we determine the region on interest (ROI) of the moving target which is followed\nadaptive color filter to extract the color information and thus the object is tracked. \nThe main contribution on\nthis paper is that the introduction on a color filtering method which is capable of adaptively identifying the\nmost salient color feature that belongs to for moving object and using this color feature for tracking.\nShravan Maheshwaran\n1SHRAVAN MAHESHWARNSHRAVAN MAHESHWARAN N RMinistry of Communication and\nInformation Technology\n24th June 2014 \u2014 18th \nJuly 2014\nWORK EXPERIENCE\nTrainee\nI had undergone training at the Department of Electronics and Information Technology ,Ministry of\ncommunications & Information Technology under the guidance of Mr. B.M Baveja (Senior Director & Scientist\nG). The work assigned to me was to study and analyze the project proposals and research papers on new\ntechnology submitted by the academia from all over India for monetary funding by the Indian government and\nwas required to brief the Director about concepts,applications,future scope and negative aspects if any\neveryday according to the work assigned  .  \nADDITIONAL SKILLS\nMicrosoft Office Module - Proficient in Excel,Powerpoint,Word\nProE -Basic Level\nINTERESTS AND ACTIVITIES\nReading - I like to spend my time reading on various subjects ,especially mythology and also love reading\nfundamental science related concepts and theories,nuclear physics in particular, it intrigues me. I like to watch\nmovies and am a god loving person by nature.\nCollege Activities - Hosted cultural programs and took part in dancing competitions, essay writing, took\nseminars related to new technology and systems like valvetronics, sensotronics,3D printing etc.\nPERSONAL DETAILS\nName: Shravan Maheshwaran N R. \nDOB : 28/05/1993.\nNationality: Indian.\nMarital Status:Single\nLinguistic Ability: English, Hindi,Telugu .\nFather's Name : N.V.R.K Murthy ( OSD ,NID Delhi Center).\nPresent Address:  C6A/4B , Janakpuri , \n                             West Delhi district, \n                             New Delhi - 110058\nDECLARATION\nI hereby declare that all the details furnished above are true to the best of my knowledge and belief.\nShravan maheshwaran N R \nShravan Maheshwaran\n2,Tamil.\nWest delhi district,\nNew Delhi -58", "annotations": [[1658, 1664, "SKILL: MatLAB"], [4064, 4071, "SKILL: Ability"], [19, 24, "SKILL: GMail"], [149, 158, "SKILL: Knowledge"], [236, 245, "SKILL: Positions"], [408, 419, "SKILL: performance"], [2724, 2734, "SKILL: Technology"], [1525, 1528, "SKILL: GPS"], [1842, 1848, "SKILL: Moving"], [3477, 3484, "SKILL: Reading"], [3867, 3881, "SKILL: New Technology"], [3641, 3648, "SKILL: Physics"], [1641, 1645, "SKILL: AXIS"], [163, 169, "SKILL: skills"], [1980, 1984, "SKILL: Time"], [1773, 1776, "SKILL: CAN"], [2712, 2734, "SKILL: Information Technology"], [3372, 3381, "SKILL: microsoft"], [1142, 1148, "SKILL: Mobile"], [1864, 1869, "SKILL: color"], [2008, 2023, "SKILL: Computer Vision"], [1967, 1974, "SKILL: Process"], [4031, 4045, "SKILL: marital status"], [2185, 2194, "SKILL: Sequences"], [842, 847, "SKILL: Robot"], [3926, 3928, "SKILL: 3D"], [3503, 3510, "SKILL: My Time"], [1619, 1622, "SKILL: RED"], [3988, 3989, "SKILL: R"], [3595, 3602, "SKILL: Science"], [362, 371, "SKILL: Education"], [350, 360, "SKILL: Management"], [3697, 3703, "SKILL: Movies"], [1529, 1534, "SKILL: Value"], [3168, 3175, "SKILL: Funding"], [2968, 2974, "SKILL: Senior"], [2958, 2959, "SKILL: M"], [3497, 3502, "SKILL: Spend"], [1580, 1584, "SKILL: MINI"], [2017, 2023, "SKILL: vision"], [2890, 2904, "SKILL: Communications"], [3126, 3134, "SKILL: Academia"], [2768, 2783, "SKILL: Work experience"], [647, 652, "SKILL: Board"], [1001, 1007, "SKILL: Sensor"], [3742, 3749, "SKILL: College"], [1404, 1414, "SKILL: monitoring"], [2808, 2816, "SKILL: Training"], [972, 978, "SKILL: System"], [2940, 2948, "SKILL: Guidance"], [908, 910, "SKILL: IS"], [1194, 1198, "SKILL: Data"], [3429, 3433, "SKILL: Word"], [3779, 3787, "SKILL: Programs"], [246, 256, "SKILL: Empowering"], [47, 59, "SKILL: Mechatronics"], [257, 267, "SKILL: Innovation"], [3372, 3388, "SKILL: Microsoft office"], [3382, 3388, "SKILL: Office"], [3084, 3090, "SKILL: Papers"], [3075, 3083, "SKILL: Research"], [2248, 2251, "SKILL: ROI"], [4082, 4087, "SKILL: Hindi"], [801, 807, "SKILL: Design"], [3418, 3428, "SKILL: Powerpoint"], [641, 646, "SKILL: State"], [399, 407, "SKILL: Academic"], [2824, 2834, "SKILL: Department"], [3053, 3070, "SKILL: Project Proposals"], [3929, 3937, "SKILL: Printing"], [812, 823, "SKILL: Fabrication"], [42, 46, "SKILL: Tech"], [3275, 3280, "SKILL: Scope"], [3412, 3417, "SKILL: Excel"], [25, 28, "SKILL: COM"], [2153, 2164, "SKILL: Information"], [334, 345, "SKILL: Engineering"], [2179, 2184, "SKILL: Video"], [3926, 3937, "SKILL: 3D Printing"], [3446, 3451, "SKILL: Level"], [2008, 2016, "SKILL: Computer"], [1665, 1673, "SKILL: Software"], [4010, 4021, "SKILL: Nationality"], [3466, 3476, "SKILL: Activities"], [2975, 2983, "SKILL: Director"], [2068, 2080, "SKILL: Surveillance"], [2267, 2273, "SKILL: TARGET"], [4073, 4080, "SKILL: English"], [2838, 2849, "SKILL: Electronics"], [1208, 1210, "SKILL: IT"], [1630, 1638, "SKILL: Tracking"], [3190, 3200, "SKILL: Government"], [3833, 3840, "SKILL: Writing"], [121, 125, "SKILL: Work"], [2986, 2995, "SKILL: Scientist"], [3075, 3090, "SKILL: Research Papers"], [197, 208, "SKILL: Challenging"], [2694, 2707, "SKILL: communication"], [3246, 3254, "SKILL: Concepts"], [3398, 3408, "SKILL: Proficient"], [3813, 3825, "SKILL: Competitions"], [793, 800, "SKILL: Project"], [3943, 3951, "SKILL: Personal"], [3255, 3267, "SKILL: Applications"], [313, 319, "SKILL: Fields"], [2292, 2300, "SKILL: Adaptive"], [3624, 3632, "SKILL: Theories"], [2452, 2461, "SKILL: Filtering"], [3847, 3855, "SKILL: Seminars"], [3061, 3070, "SKILL: Proposals"], [305, 312, "SKILL: Diverse"], [1788, 1799, "SKILL: Identifying"], [3886, 3893, "SKILL: Systems"], [272, 282, "SKILL: Creativity"]]}
