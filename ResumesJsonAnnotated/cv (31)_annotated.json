The Brain computer interface module absorbed thes e brain commands, which consists of \nElectro encephalo graphy (EEG). Then these data signals sent to microcontroller to control the switch.  \nPERSONAL PROFILE  \nAge & Date of birth         :             24 &  05-11-1992  \nNationality     :             Indian  \nMarital  status    :             Single  \nPassport number                  :             M4084030  \nPassport expiry date            :             27-11-2024  \nLanguages known                :             English, Tamil  \nDECLARATION  \nI hereby declare that the above particulars furnished by me are true to the best of my knowledge and belief.  \nDate:             \nPlace:                                                              (H.
