EDUCATION\nDual Degree (B.tech + M.Tech)(Chemical) from Indian Institute of\nTechnology (IIT), Kharagpur in 2019PERSONAL PROFILE\nThe majority of my work experience\nincludes Computer Vision, Deep Learning\nand NLP. I have worked on traditional\nmachine learning algorithms like SVM,\nRandom Forest, Logistic Regression, Linear\nRegression, KNN, K-means Clustering, etc.\nand Deep Learning algorithms like YOLO,\nBaidu's DeepSpeech, FCN on Keras and\nPytorch architectures. WORK BACKGROUND\nInnoplexus \nData Scientist Nov 2019 to Till Date \nBuild an end-to-end, Computer Vision and NLP-based PDF-Extractor\nmodel to convert unstructured congress research paper pdf documents\ninto a structured and categorical format with a micro-average F1-score\nof 0.84. \nCreated a model for identification and conversion of the graphical\nrepresentations of chemical structures from literature sources into\nSMILES. Used OpenCV for various image preprocessing and OSRA an\nopen-sourced tool for SMILES generation.\nOTHER ACTIVITIES\nNatural Language Mastery - DataCampPROJECTS\nEnd-to-End Computer Vision Model for\nHindi Sentence Recognition.", "annotations": [[49, 55, "SKILL: python"], [153, 163, "SKILL: Processing"], [334, 344, "SKILL: Technology"], [79, 86, "SKILL: PySpark"], [662, 667, "SKILL: Baidu"], [12, 26, "SKILL: Data Scientist"], [1022, 1036, "SKILL: Identification"], [1113, 1123, "SKILL: literature"], [34, 47, "SKILL: Deep Learning"], [176, 188, "SKILL: Intelligence"], [89, 101, "SKILL: data science"], [27, 33, "SKILL: skills"], [190, 205, "SKILL: Computer Vision"], [70, 77, "SKILL: Pytorch"], [552, 571, "SKILL: Logistic regression"], [299, 307, "SKILL: Chemical"], [108, 116, "SKILL: Analysis"], [39, 47, "SKILL: Learning"], [94, 101, "SKILL: Science"], [259, 268, "SKILL: Education"], [291, 292, "SKILL: M"], [199, 205, "SKILL: vision"], [144, 163, "SKILL: Language Processing"], [405, 420, "SKILL: Work experience"], [561, 571, "SKILL: regression"], [233, 239, "SKILL: OpenCV"], [12, 16, "SKILL: Data"], [228, 231, "SKILL: NLP"], [207, 214, "SKILL: Pattern"], [499, 526, "SKILL: Machine Learning algorithms"], [118, 134, "SKILL: machine learning"], [892, 900, "SKILL: Research"], [1340, 1345, "SKILL: Hindi"], [516, 526, "SKILL: Algorithms"], [537, 550, "SKILL: Random Forest"], [788, 793, "SKILL: build"], [853, 858, "SKILL: Model"], [1259, 1275, "SKILL: Natural Language"], [284, 288, "SKILL: Tech"], [215, 226, "SKILL: Recognition"], [839, 842, "SKILL: PDF"], [274, 280, "SKILL: Degree"], [532, 535, "SKILL: SVM"], [605, 615, "SKILL: Clustering"], [190, 198, "SKILL: Computer"], [1248, 1258, "SKILL: Activities"], [592, 595, "SKILL: KNN"], [57, 60, "SKILL: sql"], [626, 650, "SKILL: Deep learning algorithms"], [144, 152, "SKILL: Language"], [1041, 1051, "SKILL: Conversion"], [405, 409, "SKILL: Work"], [17, 26, "SKILL: Scientist"], [1175, 1188, "SKILL: Preprocessing"], [63, 68, "SKILL: Keras"], [1169, 1188, "SKILL: Image Preprocessing"], [707, 720, "SKILL: Architectures"], [943, 954, "SKILL: Categorical"]]}
