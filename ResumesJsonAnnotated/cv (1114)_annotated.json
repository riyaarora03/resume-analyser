{"text": "Robyn Goss  \nAddress . \nPhone Number  \nEmail address  \n24 January 2015  \nMr. Gary Hill  \nThe Robot Company  \n1250 N. Bellflower Blvd.  \nLong Beach, CA 90840  \n \nDear Mr. Hill,  \nAfter exploring current projects that The Robot Company is undertaking, I am interested in applying for the \nposition of Project Manager for the ATeChToP project.  \nMy understanding of ATeChToP is that The Robot Company seeks to enable children to play and so cialize \nwhere otherwise their medical condition could not allow the risk. I hope that my passion for the project can \nhelp to make this objective an established reality.  \nMy interest in Biomedical Engineering began as a high school student with obscure inte rest in the field, and \nas one who vaguely understood that BME encompassed both mathematics and the medical field. During my \nundergraduate career at California State University Long Beach not only has my knowledge of the field \ngrown, but so has my excitemen t. Adding Electrical Engineering as an additional degree has strengthened \nmy technical capabilities as an engineer which can be integrated into the medical field.  \nI feel that my experimental work while at California S tate University Long Beach will  prove b eneficial to \nthe project: I have had practice constructing a rudimentary ECG amplifier, and have also had practice \nrecording and analyzing my own heart sounds and EEG signals using MATLAB and CleveMed BioRadio \nsoftware. Throughout my coursework, I have add ed considerable experience with microcontroller \nprogramming environments such as Atmel AVR for the Arduino Uno, and experience working with FPGA \ndesign through ISE Design Suite. My familiarity working with circuit simulation through OrCAD PSpice \nand NI Mul tisim might al so prove useful . \nMy internships for the company Raytheon as well as for Ametek Aerospace and Defense have given me \ninvaluable experience communicating efficiently as a growing engineer. My involvement in creating \nsimulation environments using  Matlab and Simulink through Xilinx software, gave me the task of bridging \nsoftware engineering teams with working project design teams to limit confusion and cultivate clarity. \nWhile at Ametek, I would oftentimes interface with customers to avouch that th eir requirements were being \nmet in terms of quality management.  \nAttached you will find my resume which better details my experiences. I hope to prove myself a valuable \nasset to The Robot Company. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss the position a nd its \nrequirements, as well as speak with you personally about my qualifications in an interview. In the event any \nquestions arise, please do not hesitate to contact me through the information provided above.  \nThank you for your time and consideration.  \nSincerely,  \nRobyn Goss  \n  Contact Information   Robyn Victoria Goss   \n \n \nSummary  A diligent professional seeking the position of Project Manager for the ATeChToP  \nprogram at The Robot Company where her tenacity and  creativity may be best \nutilized . \n\uf0b7 Profici ent knowledge in Microsoft O ffice tools, MATLAB, Simulink , ORCAD  PSpice,  Multisim  \n\uf0b7 Experience working with Eclipse , Assembly, PBasic, ISE Design Suite , and Modelsim  \n \nEducation  B.S.
