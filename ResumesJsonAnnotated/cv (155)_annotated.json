Air leakage detector is a project to intimate the alarm signal when there is any leakage in the\ntank. T he field of mechanical engineering has a theme word called change as its backbone. In our\nproject the main parameter is pneumatic pressure (30m to 40m bar).\n                     The main components of project are sensor units, microcontroller units, power supply units,\ndisplay units. Sensor are using for detection of electromagnetic radiation from the natural sources. Then\nthis signal will transfer to microcontroller units. The main function of microcontroller is storage unit.\nThen this data will transfer to display unit as a buzzer sounds.\n.  \n1\nEXPERIENCE\nCompany: LOIUS & SONS\nPosition: FIRE FIGHTING
