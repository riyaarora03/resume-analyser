I am writing to apply for the \nposition.\nI understand that McDuff is making a major effort to build a full-scale equipment \ndevelopment laboratory. That prospect interests me greatly, because of my academic background in \nelectrical engineering. At CSULB, I took courses in several subjects that might be useful in the lab\u2019s\nwork \u2013 for example, microprocessor applications, artificial intelligence, and fiber optics.\nAlso, related work at Jones Energy & Automation, Inc. has given me experience building \nand developing new electronics systems. In particular, my work as an assembler taught me the \nimportance of precision and quality control. I would like the opportunity to apply this knowledge at \nMcDuff.\nEnclosed is my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, which focuses on the skills gained from my work experience and \nacademic coursework that would transfer to your firm. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss\nmy qualifications with you. Should any questions arise concerning the information on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, \nplease do not hesitate to contact me through the email address or telephone number provided above.\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to our meeting in the near future.\nSincerely,\nJohn SmithJ  ohn   S  mith                     ___________________________  \n4875 Inglewood Avenue\nRedondo Beach CA 90278\nCell: (310) 316-0932\nEmail: JSmith@ucla.edu\nOBJECTIVE: \nSeeking an internship position in electrical engineering with an emphasis in the \navionics and electronics industry.\nEDUCATION:\nCalifornia State University, Long Beach .
