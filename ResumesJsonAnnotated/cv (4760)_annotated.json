Uses effective and efficient\nmethods of teaching while focusing on the individual needs of each student.\nHighlights\nCentral Missouri Math Educators club member\nMissouri Council of Teachers of Mathematics 2014 Conference\nTutoring experience\nMS Office proficient\nOrganized\nTimely\nAccomplishments\nWhile working for Beauty Brands I received two awards. I received the Award of Excellence and Shift Manager of the Year. The Award of\nExcellence is a company wide award and is awarded to one person from each district. Out of seven locations I was chosen for my district. I was\npresented the award at Beauty Brands annual banquet in Kansas City. I accepted the award from the founder and CEO and was recognized in\nfront of all of home office, location managers, and other award winners. The next year I was awarded with Shift Manager of the Year for my\ndistrict.\nExperience\nI have a little over 100 hours of observation and participation field experience. Sixty hours of my field experience are observations from algebra I\nat Lees Summit High School summer school and 6th grade math and social studies at Brittany Hill. Fifteen hours were spent at Holden Middle\nSchool tutoring 6th through 8th graders in various contents. I spent twelve hours observing special education students in both a general education\nand special education classrooms. I finished about twenty hours in a 6th grade math class at Grain Valley South Middle School. One of my peers\nand I taught three different lessons and led several small groups in discussions about various math articles. One lesson we taught was reviewing\norder of operations. Since the students were newly familiar with the information we wanted them to get some practice working on various\nproblems using multiple operations. We played \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have, who has?\u00e2\u20ac\u200b As each student read their equation to the class I would write it on the\nboard so that they could visualize it and write it down. Students would call out the answer when it was their card and then we solved the problem\non the board as a class before we moved on to the next card. The students really enjoyed this because it was something that we did all together\nand they saw it as more of a game and thought it was fun.\nWork History\nCompany Name\n \nJanuary 2014\n \nto
