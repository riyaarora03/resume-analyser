Pelton turbine is most efficient at this \ncondition. Thus, more power power can be extracted from a water source with high \npressure and low flow than from a source with low pressure and high flow, even \nwhen the two flows theoretically contain the same power. Pelton wheels are made in\nall sizes.\nINDUSTRIAL TRAINING\n1.Bharat  Heavy  Electricals  Limited  Haridwar:  BHEL  is  the  largest\nengineering  and  manufacturing  enterprise  in  India  in  the  energy  related\ninfrastructure  sector  today.
