Together, the GATE identified students and I, created a school newspaper.\nWe named it the Jr Journal and invented five topics that would be in every issue. I helped create an outline and template that our reporters could\nfollow and eventually do independently. Each student chose a different topic every month and would either interview or research to write an article\nfor that section. They would then write a rough draft, that I would edit, and then they would type the final draft and put it into the newspaper\ntemplate. Students would also have a chance to find graphics or take pictures that fit their topic. It turned out great and we were able to publish\nfour issues. This will be our second year. This was a great accomplishment for me as an educator, because I love to write and was in my school\nnewspaper in High School. I had the chance to share a passion of mine and see students enjoy coming in after school and put their advanced\nbrains to work. It was such a great experience and can't wait to have that again this year.", "annotations": [[5207, 5214, "SKILL: Passion"], [2158, 2169, "SKILL: Maintaining"], [540, 544, "SKILL: Arts"], [2688, 2705, "SKILL: Critical Thinking"], [1408, 1418, "SKILL: Strategies"], [27, 40, "SKILL: People skills"], [122, 132, "SKILL: Technology"], [776, 782, "SKILL: Tenure"], [954, 961, "SKILL: Reading"], [1042, 1051, "SKILL: Behaviors"], [363, 371, "SKILL: Educator"], [8, 14, "SKILL: skills"], [2523, 2531, "SKILL: Projects"], [620, 627, "SKILL: Company"], [5343, 5346, "SKILL: CAN"], [5166, 5177, "SKILL: High School"], [991, 1013, "SKILL: Positive reinforcement"], [57, 58, "SKILL: C"], [5227, 5230, "SKILL: See"], [1397, 1407, "SKILL: Developing"], [1956, 1960, "SKILL: Fire"], [75, 76, "SKILL: R"], [1104, 1112, "SKILL: Learning"], [372, 381, "SKILL: Education"], [2178, 2183, "SKILL: Focus"], [3179, 3192, "SKILL: Opportunities"], [3168, 3174, "SKILL: Blocks"], [1138, 1149, "SKILL: Instruction"], [1368, 1374, "SKILL: Levels"], [3130, 3138, "SKILL: Feedback"], [5015, 5021, "SKILL: Issues"], [550, 562, "SKILL: Liberal Arts"], [2806, 2810, "SKILL: Team"], [84, 105, "SKILL: Organizational Skills"], [4096, 4106, "SKILL: Leadership"], [1928, 1939, "SKILL: Field Trips"], [1128, 1134, "SKILL: System"], [3109, 3115, "SKILL: Supply"], [1064, 1072, "SKILL: Children"], [3994, 4010, "SKILL: English language"], [3453, 3464, "SKILL: Communicate"], [3656, 3664, "SKILL: Programs"], [224, 236, "SKILL: Expectations"], [1242, 1247, "SKILL: Needs"], [3792, 3796, "SKILL: Star"], [3873, 3880, "SKILL: Written"], [4688, 4696, "SKILL: Research"], [528, 544, "SKILL: Bachelor of Arts"], [4811, 4815, "SKILL: Type"], [1276, 1281, "SKILL: Plans"], [464, 469, "SKILL: State"], [4785, 4789, "SKILL: EDIT"], [84, 98, "SKILL: Organizational"], [3933, 3957, "SKILL: Professional Development"], [1460, 1468, "SKILL: Dynamics"], [600, 619, "SKILL: Teaching Experience"], [5070, 5084, "SKILL: accomplishment"], [833, 840, "SKILL: Trainer"], [1073, 1076, "SKILL: Per"], [3846, 3857, "SKILL: Assessments"], [2788, 2792, "SKILL: Meet"], [927, 938, "SKILL: Development"], [2825, 2829, "SKILL: Math"], [600, 608, "SKILL: teaching"], [1269, 1281, "SKILL: Lesson plans"], [3765, 3771, "SKILL: Assess"], [4914, 4922, "SKILL: Graphics"], [884, 889, "SKILL: Level"], [1198, 1208, "SKILL: Activities"], [5199, 5204, "SKILL: SHARE"], [122, 138, "SKILL: Technology Savvy"], [3994, 4001, "SKILL: English"], [2066, 2079, "SKILL: Understanding"], [4431, 4433, "SKILL: IT"], [1301, 1308, "SKILL: Lessons"], [1918, 1927, "SKILL: Organized"], [27, 33, "SKILL: People"], [918, 926, "SKILL: Language"], [2893, 2900, "SKILL: Writing"], [3832, 3845, "SKILL: Comprehension"], [5302, 5306, "SKILL: Work"], [3197, 3204, "SKILL: Support"], [3755, 3763, "SKILL: Progress"], [218, 236, "SKILL: Clear expectations"], [966, 978, "SKILL: StoryTelling"], [133, 138, "SKILL: SAVVY"], [3933, 3945, "SKILL: Professional"]]}
