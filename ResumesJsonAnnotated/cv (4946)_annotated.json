I have previously worked\non some corporate models and due to its\nintricacies I want to explore more in the\ndomain.WORK BACKGROUND\nXcelSior \nSDE , May 2019 - Till date\nUsed unsupervised learning algorithms like DBSCAN to identify new\nidentities in the system. This was used to increase the number of\nidentities in the Face recognition pipeline. Enhanced this setup by\nimplementing the K-Means algorithm as well.\nOTHER ACTIVITIES\nB.Tech(Metallurgy) CIT, Calicut, 2019PROJECTS\nFace Recognition system", "annotations": [[45, 51, "SKILL: python"], [107, 111, "SKILL: java"], [184, 194, "SKILL: Technology"], [122, 127, "SKILL: NoSQL"], [72, 82, "SKILL: TensorFlow"], [283, 292, "SKILL: Full time"], [33, 39, "SKILL: skills"], [288, 292, "SKILL: Time"], [146, 155, "SKILL: Computers"], [40, 41, "SKILL: C"], [323, 331, "SKILL: Learning"], [242, 259, "SKILL: Software Engineer"], [128, 137, "SKILL: Education"], [99, 105, "SKILL: Kotlin"], [505, 526, "SKILL: Unsupervised learning"], [14, 32, "SKILL: Software Developer"], [84, 90, "SKILL: pandas"], [584, 590, "SKILL: System"], [251, 259, "SKILL: Engineer"], [440, 446, "SKILL: Domain"], [315, 331, "SKILL: machine learning"], [738, 742, "SKILL: WELL"], [527, 537, "SKILL: Algorithms"], [92, 97, "SKILL: numpy"], [725, 734, "SKILL: Algorithm"], [473, 476, "SKILL: SDE"], [140, 144, "SKILL: Tech"], [293, 298, "SKILL: Roles"], [655, 666, "SKILL: Recognition"], [667, 675, "SKILL: Pipeline"], [376, 382, "SKILL: Models"], [14, 22, "SKILL: Software"], [700, 712, "SKILL: Implementing"], [750, 760, "SKILL: Activities"], [543, 549, "SKILL: DBSCAN"], [275, 279, "SKILL: Work"], [53, 61, "SKILL: Firebase"], [366, 375, "SKILL: Corporate"], [505, 517, "SKILL: Unsupervised"], [113, 120, "SKILL: MongoDB"]]}
