Based on this we concluded that glass \u2018C\u2019 is used as laser\nactive medium for emission at 600 nm.Project submitted (B.SC - 2007):\nTitle: Magnetic Susceptibility studies on oils for curing prolonged\njoint pain as a consequence of chikkun-gunia.\n                              \nObjective:\n         The objective of this project is to study the magnetic susceptibility of \nthese oils and to determine the best one among these oils to be used to cure\nthe prolonged joint pain.\n        This is a rural application oriented project which may be helpful to \novercome the new outbreak of chikungunya viral fever.\nMethodology: Quincke\u2019s Method\nFormula used:  K = 2h\u1e55g/H\u00b2,Mass susceptibility = 2 hg/H\u00b2     \nSummary:                      \nIn  this  we  have  adopted  Quincke\u2019s  method  to  determine  the\nmagnetic susceptibility.\nHere we have taken liquid samples and we determined whether it is Dia,\nPara or Ferro magnet.\n         Para magnetic substances are having positive susceptibility value\nand Diamagnetic substances are having negative susceptibility value, and\nFerromagnetic material is large positive value.\n       Based on the results we concluded the properties of each oil and we\nfounded Paramagnetic materials are the best oils which can be used for\njoint pain relief. \nConclusion:\n         Finally we founded that Paramagnetic materials are the best oils which\ncan be used for joint pain relief. \nProject submitted (B.SC - 2007):\nTitle: Socio & Emotional Climate Of School Students in Dindigul\nDistrict\n                              \nObjective:\nIn this we studied ambience of schools & Emotional characters of School\nstudents in Dindigul District\n               \nMethodology: Descriptive Survey MethodFormula used: Mean, Standard Deviation, Test of Significance\n  \nSummary: \nInitially we have selected 77 secondary students from two different schools.\nWe used stratified random sampling technique which will have more \nstatistical efficient.\n                 \nConclusion:\n      \n      In this  study, the investigator has attempted to study the Socio-\nemotional climate of schools. Since the role of the teacher is very important\nin shaping the personality of the student, it is always necessary to see that\nthe teacher should be well trained not only in academic aspect but also non-\nacademic  aspects.  Emotional  climate  of  schools  should  be  given  due\nimportance in regarding with social climate. For this, the administrator\u2019s role\nis  more  important  in  order  to  maintain  good  socio-emotional  climate  is\nschool.\nAchievements\nM.SC Project was published on \u201cThe International Journal of \nluminescence\u201d.\nPersonal Strength\nPositive learning altitude.\nCreative outlook and clarity of thoughts.\nExcellent interpersonal skills.\nSelf motivated, firm determined, workaholic.\nLike to accept challenges.\nPersonal Profile\nFather\u2019s Name             :   N.Kailasam\nDate of Birth                :   10-09-1990\nGender                         :   Female\nNationality                   :   Indian\nMailing Address            :   #7/7, Sri Raghavendra Flats,\n                                             G-4, \u201cSai Sankalpa\u201d,\n                                             Kuppusami Pillai Street,\n                                             Guduvancheri \u2013 603202.\nHobbies\nEngaging myself participating in Social services among the people who are \nat BPL (Below poverty line), Listening and Playing Music.Yours Faithfully\n(K.MEENAKSHI)", "annotations": [[1949, 1955, "SKILL: copper"], [2870, 2875, "SKILL: Bonds"], [0, 6, "SKILL: Resume"], [5026, 5030, "SKILL: MEAN"], [1261, 1275, "SKILL: Investigations"], [466, 473, "SKILL: Physics"], [3467, 3474, "SKILL: Studies"], [6042, 6048, "SKILL: skills"], [2459, 2467, "SKILL: Physical"], [2955, 2962, "SKILL: network"], [239, 242, "SKILL: CAN"], [2530, 2543, "SKILL: Concentration"], [174, 180, "SKILL: Growth"], [1857, 1858, "SKILL: C"], [2646, 2648, "SKILL: DI"], [5510, 5513, "SKILL: See"], [6612, 6627, "SKILL: Social Services"], [1569, 1577, "SKILL: Analysis"], [5957, 5965, "SKILL: Learning"], [542, 549, "SKILL: Science"], [984, 993, "SKILL: Education"], [4287, 4292, "SKILL: Value"], [5985, 5992, "SKILL: Outlook"], [6028, 6048, "SKILL: Interpersonal skills"], [92, 101, "SKILL: Associate"], [532, 538, "SKILL: Master"], [1198, 1199, "SKILL: M"], [5230, 5241, "SKILL: Statistical"], [5731, 5744, "SKILL: Administrator"], [2553, 2559, "SKILL: Radius"], [380, 385, "SKILL: Board"], [744, 763, "SKILL: Bachelor of Science"], [1410, 1412, "SKILL: IS"], [3072, 3081, "SKILL: Character"], [2721, 2728, "SKILL: Pattern"], [5456, 5467, "SKILL: Personality"], [5541, 5545, "SKILL: WELL"], [487, 500, "SKILL: Qualification"], [5566, 5574, "SKILL: Academic"], [2223, 2227, "SKILL: FTIR"], [6705, 6710, "SKILL: Music"], [3802, 3813, "SKILL: Application"], [4999, 5005, "SKILL: Survey"], [4434, 4441, "SKILL: Results"], [5242, 5251, "SKILL: Efficient"], [44, 49, "SKILL: Phone"], [243, 248, "SKILL: Train"], [2051, 2061, "SKILL: Mechanical"], [6224, 6230, "SKILL: gender"], [2062, 2070, "SKILL: Strength"], [6018, 6048, "SKILL: Excellent interpersonal skills"], [40, 43, "SKILL: COM"], [4766, 4773, "SKILL: Climate"], [501, 507, "SKILL: Degree"], [6055, 6064, "SKILL: Motivated"], [6266, 6277, "SKILL: Nationality"], [4478, 4481, "SKILL: Oil"], [1975, 1986, "SKILL: Temperature"], [1826, 1828, "SKILL: IT"], [6028, 6041, "SKILL: Interpersonal"], [1513, 1524, "SKILL: Methodology"], [354, 365, "SKILL: Residential"], [2692, 2702, "SKILL: Conclusion"], [5041, 5050, "SKILL: Deviation"], [5060, 5072, "SKILL: Significance"], [1617, 1627, "SKILL: Parameters"], [6638, 6644, "SKILL: People"], [4987, 4998, "SKILL: Descriptive"], [2181, 2184, "SKILL: Ray"], [5052, 5056, "SKILL: Test"], [5997, 6004, "SKILL: Clarity"], [144, 148, "SKILL: Work"], [2771, 2773, "SKILL: IR"], [673, 681, "SKILL: Duration"], [4380, 4388, "SKILL: Material"], [2178, 2179, "SKILL: X"], [1698, 1707, "SKILL: Materials"], [6683, 6692, "SKILL: Listening"], [6668, 6675, "SKILL: Poverty"], [1179, 1186, "SKILL: Project"], [5930, 5938, "SKILL: Personal"], [437, 445, "SKILL: Handling"], [6619, 6627, "SKILL: Services"], [2840, 2850, "SKILL: Stretching"], [125, 137, "SKILL: Organisation"], [3510, 3514, "SKILL: Pain"], [624, 631, "SKILL: Regular"], [5788, 5796, "SKILL: Maintain"], [2080, 2087, "SKILL: Quality"], [5189, 5197, "SKILL: Sampling"], [2508, 2513, "SKILL: Index"], [6259, 6265, "SKILL: Female"]]}
