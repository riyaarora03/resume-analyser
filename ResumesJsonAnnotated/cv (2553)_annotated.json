It presents a design of a low-cost; high-efficiency drive capable of supplying\na single-phase a.c induction motor with a  PWM modulated sinusoidal voltage . The circuit \noperation is controlled by an microcontroller. The device is aimed at substituting the \ncommonly used triac phase angle control drives.\nThe drive uses a PWM controlled MOSFET and the load in series with a bridge rectifier. This\ndrive based on this new control technique is targeted for use in consumer and industrial \nproducts: washing machine, dishwashers, ventilators, compressors, and wherever the system \ncost is a consideration.\nIndustrial Training : \n\uf0b745 days Summer  Training  from  N.T.P.C.(National  Thermal\nPower corporation ltd .),Badarpur,New Delhi_110044.\n\uf0b7N.T.P.C. is a govt. of india enterprises.\n\uf0b7From 15/06/10 to 20/07/10.\nTrained here as :\n\uf0b7Site Engg(Electrical)\n\uf0b7Gets skills about substation installation of  400/220kV.\n         Various transmission knowledge\nTechnical     skills  :\uf0b7Languages: C\n\uf0b7Knowledge of MS Project\n\uf0b7Matlab Simulation\nProfessional Qualification :     \nExam Details College/University Year Of Passing division\n \nB.TECH(EEE\nENGG)M.D.U(HARYANA) 2012 1st \nAcademic Qualification:   \n              \nExam Details College/University Year Of Passing Divison\nIntermediate B.S.E.B PATNA 2007 2nd \nMatriculation B.S.E.B PATNA 2005 2nd \nPassport Details:\nPassport No. Date of issue Place of issue Date of Expiry\nM8780042 24/04/2015 PATNA 23/04/2025\nAchievement: \n\uf0b73rd  rank in 5th &6th  semester in B.TECH\n\uf0b71st  rank in 7th & 8th  semester in B.TECH\nSpecial skills :                                                                                                                          \nOperating system                                                      window XP/2007   &Windows 8  & 10      \nWord processing                                                        MS- office                                                 \nProfessional Strength :                                                                                           Always recognized for outstanding work ethics, integrity, thoroughness and Commitment to \norganizations benefit.
