I found myself increasingly drawn to understanding the science behind the technology, and \ndecided to pursue a career in Electrical Engineering.  \n \nAs a Student Engineer Intern at The Boei ng Company  for a year and a half , I have had the opportunity \nto learn about 3D modeling on CATIA V5. Collaborating  with a team of electrical engineers, I have \nworked  on wiring design project s for the raceway cabin , onboard networking systems, and lower lob es \nof various 7 -series airplanes.  In addition, I have also worked as an Engineer  Assistant at LKK \nManufacturing, where I had the chance to learn about working with suppliers, logistics, and mechanics \nto put together efficient production schedules that meet  sales and business needs.  \n \nI would like to be a candidate for the Manufacturing Line Manager and 3D modeling positions , as my \nexperience in 3D modeling  and managing the daily tasks of running a manufacturing plant is highly \napplicable for the position. Alternatively, I would like to be on the systems team. Given the chance, I \nwould like to work on the Prusa i3 dual extrusion head  or the bio -printer projects.  \n \nI look forward to hearing from you about the opportunity to join the EE 400D Robot Company.  \n \nSince rely, \n \nJennifer So  \n     \n JENNIFER SO  \nADDRESS  \nPHONE: \u2219 EMAIL:  \n \nOBJECTIVE  \nSeeking a Manufacturing Line Manager position at the EE 400D Robot Company.  \n \nEDUCATION  \nBachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering                  December  2013   \nCalifornia State University, Long Beach    \nBachelor of Arts in Psychology                      March  2009  \nUniversity of California , Los Angeles    \n \nPROFESSIONAL  EXPERIENCE  \nThe Boeing Company , Student Engineer Intern          Long Beach, CA            March 2012 \u2013 Present  \nELECTRICAL ENGINEERING - WIRE DESIGN AND INSTALLATION                June 2013 \u2013 Present  \n\uf0b7 Design wiring using 3D modeling tools such as CATIA for raceway and lower lobe on 7 -series airplanes  \n\uf0b7 Maintain wire harness detail and assembly design on 737 cabin raceway using CATIA V5 , Enovia, and WIRS  \n\uf0b7 Convert wire harness assembly of racew ay models from CATIA V4 to V5  \n \nPRODUCT SUPPORT ENGINEERI NG - FAULT ISOLATION                March 2012 \u2013 June 2013  \n\uf0b7 Created fault isolatio n procedures in FIM for airplane avionics, electrical, lighting, and hy draulic systems with \nthe use of wiring diagrams and  system schematics  \n\uf0b7 Updated FIM troubleshooting procedures for electrical co mponents and electrical systems  \n\uf0b7 Teamed with the e -MOD organization to convert older, non -SGML troubleshooting documents into modern \nSGML data, and enhance Fault Isolation Manual products to include digital serv ices to all airline customers  \n \nLKK Manufacturing, Engineer  Assistant    Industry, CA               June 2010 \u2013 March 2012  \n\uf0b7 Work with vendors, logistics and mechanics to create production schedules that meet sales and business goals  \n\uf0b7 Tracked inventory , monitor ed daily usage trends for production line, and  managed  logistics of machinery parts  \n\uf0b7 Maintained contractor and vendor relations to obtain necessary building maintenance services, machinery parts, \nand engineering tools for optimal pricing and quality  \n \nComcast Networks , E!
