{"text": "MOHAMMED ABDUL KHAYOOM\nMobile: +91-8099914812\nE-Mail: mohd.abdulkhayoom786@gmail.co m\nOBJECTIVE   : To work hard with full dedication for the achievement of organization objective under\nsatisfying job contact, hence enhancing my skill and knowledge and ready to learn new things.\nEDUCATION:\nDEGREE UNIVERSITY/COLLEGE YEAR\nGraduation \u2013B-tech (EEE) VISHWA  BHARATHI  COLLEGE  OF\nENGINEERING2010-2014\nIntermediate- MPC Sri Chaitanya Jr. Kalasala 2008-2010\nCBSE Kendriya Vidyalaya(OFPM) 1998-2008\nPROJECT REPORT :\n1)PROJECT TITLE: Modeling and Simulation of Matrix Converter Based DC-DC Converter\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION: The modeling and simulation of DC-DC converter with matrix converter as its \nbasic topology. DC- DC converters are frequently utilized in traction motor speed control and switched \nmode power supply. Control of speed of dc motor is specially required where supply is dc voltage Matrix \nconverter does not have energy storage components as compared to conventional converters which use \nenergy storage components..  In this paper, DC-DC converter is proposed to generate a variable dc voltage \nfrom a fixed dc voltage using single phase matrix converter topology that has been used in direct AC-AC \nconverter application. State space modeling is developed taking currents as state variables. But using \ninductance in load generates some distortions in output of converter. As frequency is increased distortions \nin the output of the converter get reduced for inductive load. The DC-DC converter is based on four \nquadrant operation of chopper and the output of converter is synthesized by using PWM technique.\n2)PROJECT TITLE: GSM BASED STEPPER MOTOR SPEED CONTROL\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION:  The goal of the project is to develop a system, which uses Mobile technology \nthat keeps control of STEPPER MOTORS in different applications, which executes with respect to the \nsignal sent by the mobile. For utilization of appliances the new concept has been thought to manage them \nremotely by using mobile, which enables the user to remotely switching and controlling of STEPPER \nmotor using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) technique. Just by dialing keypad of remote telephone, from \nwhere you are calling you can perform ON / OFF and at the same time we can control the speed of Stepper \nmotor operation. The ranges of appliances that can be controlled through tele remote systems are many in \nnumbers.  Some of them are as follows and this depends upon the usage priority of the appliances i.e. \nparking Lights, Music System or other electrical / electronic appliances.\nWORK EXPERIENCE :  \n1)ArkEN
