I believe that I have the requ ired \nbackground to carry out the duties as outlined in the advertisement. A brief summary of my experience and vision for the above \nposition is outlined below. \n \nI have 21 years of teaching and research experience at the Penn sylvania State University, wher e I am currently working as a \nProfessor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineerin g. My main areas of research interests are in parallel and \ndistributed computer architectures, cluster computing, interconnection networks, on-chip interconnects, multi-core/SoC architectures, mobile computing, Internet QoS, performance evaluation, and fault- tolerant computing. These areas cover most of the \ntopics listed in the advertisement for the Computer System Architecture Program. I have published extensively in these areas in  \nmajor international journals such as the IEEE Transactions on Computers (TC), IEEE Tr ans. on Parallel and Distributed Systems \n(TPDS), and Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing (JPDC), and highly selective conference proceedings such as ISCA, HPCA, SIGMETRICS, MICRO, ICDCS, IPDPS, SPAA, and FTCS/DSN. I have served on the Program Committee of most of these \nconferences, and have served on the Editorial  Boards of the IEEE TC and TPDS, the two premier journals in the architecture area . I \nwas the Program Chair of the 12th HPCA, HPCA-2006. \n \nMy research has been continuously supported by NSF, in particular the Architecture Program, since 1988. I have been funded by both the CCF and CNS divisions from four different programs (Architecture, Distributed Systems, Security, and Wireless Networks). In addition, I have an ongoing CISE/Research Infrastructure grant. I have participated in many CAREER and regular \nproposal review panels for almost 20 years and was a member of the Committee of Visitors for the CNS program in 2006.  Thus, I have a broad background in many overlapping areas with architect ure and I believe such a background is essential for steering t he \narchitecture research in the coming years.  \n \nIn addition to the current research themes as outlined in the jo b description, I envision to explore other new/challenging rese arch \nareas in computer architecture such as na no-computing, bio-inspired computing, memory and I/O systems, and architecture-level \nsupport for virtualization and security. Spec ifically, I would like to expand the scop e of the architecture research starting f rom the \nlow-level micro-architecture/VLSI design to  compiler, OS and applications. Since I am familiar with the relevant Programs in bo th \nthe CCF and CNS divisions, I should be able to strengthen the Architecture Research Program during my tenure at NSF. \n \nI have enclosed a copy of my resume along with this letter.  Please let me know if you ne ed any additional information. \n \nThank you for considering my application. \n \nSincerely, \n \n \nChita R. Das \nProfessor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering. \n \n ", "annotations": [[155, 158, "SKILL: Fax"], [252, 260, "SKILL: Building"], [2928, 2931, "SKILL: I/O"], [1683, 1705, "SKILL: Conference proceedings"], [1220, 1236, "SKILL: Mobile Computing"], [1252, 1263, "SKILL: performance"], [241, 251, "SKILL: Technology"], [1247, 1250, "SKILL: QoS"], [3386, 3392, "SKILL: Resume"], [80, 96, "SKILL: computer science"], [3339, 3345, "SKILL: Tenure"], [2831, 2835, "SKILL: Arch"], [1201, 1204, "SKILL: SOC"], [2977, 2991, "SKILL: Virtualization"], [1220, 1226, "SKILL: Mobile"], [1157, 1165, "SKILL: networks"], [1530, 1539, "SKILL: Computers"], [3548, 3549, "SKILL: R"], [29, 46, "SKILL: Equal opportunity"], [89, 96, "SKILL: Science"], [1264, 1274, "SKILL: Evaluation"], [1575, 1594, "SKILL: Distributed Systems"], [1390, 1409, "SKILL: System architecture"], [1122, 1139, "SKILL: Cluster Computing"], [1632, 1653, "SKILL: Distributed computing"], [783, 789, "SKILL: vision"], [228, 236, "SKILL: Sciences"], [868, 887, "SKILL: Research experience"], [2577, 2586, "SKILL: Architect"], [3312, 3328, "SKILL: Research Program"], [2, 9, "SKILL: College"], [1390, 1396, "SKILL: System"], [814, 816, "SKILL: IS"], [1086, 1097, "SKILL: Distributed"], [346, 355, "SKILL: Personnel"], [1252, 1274, "SKILL: Performance evaluation"], [2201, 2209, "SKILL: Programs"], [1488, 1496, "SKILL: Journals"], [868, 876, "SKILL: Research"], [3138, 3144, "SKILL: Design"], [194, 199, "SKILL: State"], [1170, 1174, "SKILL: CHIP"], [705, 711, "SKILL: Duties"], [2325, 2339, "SKILL: Infrastructure"], [66, 76, "SKILL: Department"], [440, 451, "SKILL: Application"], [460, 463, "SKILL: NSF"], [2260, 2268, "SKILL: wireless"], [1141, 1156, "SKILL: Interconnection"], [364, 380, "SKILL: National Science"], [1836, 1847, "SKILL: Conferences"], [1046, 1064, "SKILL: Research Interests"], [2404, 2410, "SKILL: Review"], [2846, 2867, "SKILL: Computer architecture"], [855, 863, "SKILL: teaching"], [216, 227, "SKILL: Information"], [3159, 3161, "SKILL: OS"], [13, 24, "SKILL: Engineering"], [1130, 1139, "SKILL: Computing"], [2958, 2963, "SKILL: Level"], [80, 88, "SKILL: Computer"], [481, 489, "SKILL: Director"], [2260, 2277, "SKILL: Wireless Networks"], [1619, 1653, "SKILL: Parallel and Distributed Computing"], [275, 279, "SKILL: Park"], [2928, 2939, "SKILL: I/O systems"], [1122, 1129, "SKILL: Cluster"], [2917, 2923, "SKILL: Memory"], [1514, 1526, "SKILL: Transactions"], [3149, 3157, "SKILL: Compiler"], [3375, 3379, "SKILL: Copy"], [519, 528, "SKILL: Selection"], [2814, 2825, "SKILL: Challenging"], [2965, 2972, "SKILL: Support"], [2246, 2254, "SKILL: Security"], [1175, 1188, "SKILL: Interconnects"], [1397, 1409, "SKILL: Architecture"], [1238, 1246, "SKILL: Internet"], [3166, 3178, "SKILL: Applications"], [2340, 2345, "SKILL: Grant"], [1107, 1120, "SKILL: Architectures"], [2386, 2393, "SKILL: Regular"], [1587, 1594, "SKILL: Systems"]]}
