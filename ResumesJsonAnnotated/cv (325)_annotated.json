The generated power can \nthen be used to charge batteries and which can later be used \nfor any electronic devices based on the power of the battery \nbeing charged by the system.  \nRole played - The whole concept of this project came into my \nmind when I was just visualizing an exhaust fan at the \ncanteen. I thought that these exhaust fans run continuously in \nlarge industries across the world. And we can utilize its \nrotation mot ion to get something useful.  \nI was actively involved and leaded our team in conceptualizing how to work flow would be. And developed the circuit designs \nfor the same and also did the actual implementation.  \nAlso It was my idea to limit the team size to three only, so that it would help me to work in future with small team size also, \nwhich can help the company to reduce the labor cost at their \nend. \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \nTTRRAAIINNIINNGG  UUNNDDEERRTTAAKKEENN::  \n AIM \u2013 To recognize the parts and accessories for motor \nvehicles at at Mithila Motors Limited and to know there usage.  \nDURATION-  6th April \u2013 5th July\u201915.  \nOBJECTIVE-  MML is a well known automobile trader and \ndealer of TATA Motors and having their own service center.  \nThe objective of this training was to know the different types of \nparts and accessories used in automobile industry.  \nWWOORRKK  EEXXPPEERRIIEENNCCEE::  \nCOMPANY:  \n \nJOB ROLE:  \nDURATION:  \n \nRESPONSIBILITIES:  \n Mithila Motors Ltd.
