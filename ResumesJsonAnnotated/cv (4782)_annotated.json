The emergency speed of the ship was activated but that is too slow. I\nsuggested to modified the linkage connection by using the left side terminal shaft of the governor. Then we were able to reach safely the port\nof Ketchikan, Alaska.\nWhen the power turbine blades of one of our Gas Turbine Engine \nwere all broken, our chief Engineer asked me if we can replace it? This\nprocedure were never done before me. I studied the video and bought a hydraulic jack and fabricate special tools so that we can separate\nthe compressor from the combustion chamber. We recorded the hydraulic pressure when we had loosen the nut of the long stud bolt that\nhold the compressor and the combustion chamber, we used the same pressure when we put it back.\nThere was a power outage, after the resumption of the power supply we lost the program of the PLC that controls our reverse osmosis\nplant.Since we don't have the program, we temporary\nconvert the control by installing relays, magnetic contactors and\ntimers and rewire it so that all sensors will function to protect the\nequipment and resume our much needed operation.\nExperience\nMechanical engineer\n
