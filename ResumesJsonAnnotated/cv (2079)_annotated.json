At the same time it is may be easier to modify and misuse the valuable\ninformation  through  hacking.  Reversible  data  hiding  (RDH)  in  encrypted  images\nmaintains the excellent property that the original cover can be losslessly recovered after\nembedded data is extracted while protecting the image content\u2019s confidentiality. In this\nmethod by reserving room before encryption with a traditional RDH algorithm is used .\nFurthermore, this  method can achieve real reversibility, separate data extraction and\ngreatly  improvement  on the quality  of marked decrypted  Images  data  extraction  and\nimage recovery are free of any errorAdditional Qualification\nDIPLOMA in Hardware and Networking\nAttended Telecom training at RTTC,TrivandrumMain Project   : B.TECH\nTeam Size:   4\nPeriod:   3 months\nSkills:   Design, Programming in VHDL, Simulation in Xilinx\nEnvironment:   Xilinx\nOperating System:   Windows 2007\nDescription: \nThe  HF  radar  receiver  system  used  for  ionospheric  measurements,  installed  at  VSSC,\nTrivandrum. The HF radar system  used  here works mainly  on  18  MHz.. This signal is\namplified  to  50kW  peak  power  in  the  transmitter  and  is  fed  to  the  antenna.  This\nelectromagnetic energy is radiated into space by antenna array. The backscattered signal from\nthe irregularities are passed through a coherent receiver where the signal is phase detected\nusing two reference signals having quadrature phase relationship. The in phase and quadrature\nphase outputs of the two phase detectors (sine and cosine channels) have all the information\ncontained in the backscattered received signal. As a part of augmentation, the receiver system\nof the HF radar to a state-of-the-art Digital Receiver using FPGA technology is to be carried\nout. \nSpecial Skills\n\uf0b7Versatile\n\uf0b7Good
